    ORDER UNORDERED LIST FIRST,THEN INSERT INTO ORDERED LIST
    arg3 = unordered memory FILENAME
    INSERTING UNORDERED LIST INTO ORDERED LIST THAT IS EMPTY
    arg2 = linearly ordered memory FILENAME in open(filename,???) format
    do a 'hard' sort on the unordered memory so insertion order doesn't matter
    then on lexico sort, change the argument to include the unordered memory
    need function that does lexicographic ordering on ORDERED AND UNORDERED memory files using basislist
    hint: order unordered list in the 'hardcore' mode, aka just rewriting file and renaming so you guarantee insertion is ok
    THEN YOU INSERT IN ORDER OF INSERTION WHICH IS NOT ACCORDING TO ORDER
    then on bisectioninsertmin if flag is true, then instead of writing, just return the pair: [obj,index]
