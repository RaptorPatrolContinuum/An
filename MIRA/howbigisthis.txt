HOLY SHIT STATEMENT+REPLACEMENT IS SO FUCKING POWERFUL ON CHARACTERS/PROPER CHOOSEN MORPHEMES

LEGEND
GREEN : conceptually done
RED : needs other things to work
PURPLE : tentatively done but can be source of bugs
STRIKETHROUGH: done
ORANGE: FUCK
===========================================================================
get notes from gmail to here
clean desktop
>check out school again
read the ELI young adults
>bank
>savings/checking
>investments
>retirement
write down fears and trends in the future I have to face
write down REALISTIC counterplay
school and timing for when I go back
TIME JUST FUCKING TRAVELS
I LOSE DAYS/MONTHS AT A TIME
exercise and having a shitty body
world news and war
desktop not being cleaned
me not being nice anymore
death and wills, etc
taxes
financial problems
food and a place to stay (hint: maslow's hierarchy of needs)
my age
getting a grill

clean phone
clear firefox

>need a new phone
>need to pass plan A

PROBLEM:
temp in california will go up to insane in 20 years | get beach area

secret is to inspire... just like good anime

>do water bottle exercise + leg exercise 



PROBLEM:
WORK HOURS ARE 1-> 5AM
I KEEP GETTING WOKEN UP BY MOTHER AND FATHER
MOTHER:
MORNING ~7-8AM OR 12AM
FATHER:
3-5PM FOR WALK
IF I SLEEP AT 9AM ->5PM I WIN

DURING WORK AT MORNING:
BLAST THE FUCK OUT OF THE MONITOR


DURING SLEEP:
USE HEADPHONES + IPHONE TO SLEEP THROUGH SCREAMING
=========================================
>>>GET AT THE BASICS / SOLVE THE BASIC PROBLEMS
>>>>AKA THINK OF EVERYTHING AND FIX THE SMALL PROBLEMS AS WELL AS BIG PROBLEMS:
EXAMPLE:
why fortnite is better than OW
in fortnite success is longer and failure is diminished
but in OW success is pushed away and failure is punished through gameplay even though they want the player to see all the content
^^^ that kind of conflict is something I want to avoid
>conflict: takes a long time to eval

>replacing function names with real thing
>>in composemeta attempt a replacement using memory files, etc
>>hint: it might be a bad idea to replace into a function since written functions are not easily evaluateable
>>instead try to eval externally AKA eval(composemeta....) -> then see where that leads you instead so you CAN eval the end result of finite functions

>some alphas#s need a better description after delta2 application

>modify abstractionGENERAL to include the input guy and output guy
input guy is the sense function
output guy is some sort of metadata or optimization or recursive self awareness

hint: poset mapping and search from top of poset chains?
figure out relationships between:
graph <-> element relation <-> higher level abstraction language <-> time required to complete operation <-> asking questions <-> problem solving <-> plan of action against myself and this
idea starting from bottom with the abstraction + actually finishing eval + some sort of feedback/maximizing qualifier/consistency qualifier ->

skipping analysis when you have a good abstraction (problem is searching for abstraction in list format)

SELF AWARENESS

Arbitrary sense function -> memorize -> abstraction
problem: 
no needs -> no questions to answer and alternative of composing everything is a scam time wize (remember that PVNP means you're fucked and have to bootstrap her up yourself)


HOW TO ASK QUESTION 
node labeling is important
hint: know answer using element relation/check AND want nonself-similar answer



==
===
AWARENESS
matching reality/sense -> abstraction -> consistency
problems: fix SI
analysis takes too long
???
>there's like another function
a 'zoom in' function where given total computing power, some sort of thing to focus on, and a max time on computation, figure out how to zoom in on what you want to focus on to be as big as possible to you fit the max time on computation

>for abstraction let's genericize it to be
given an arbitrary sense function , memory, and time
figure out what's a good balance between memorize and create abstraction
===
THE PRESENTATION
>fix actually isom since I am changing shittySI
#1: match reality
#2: ASK QUESTIONS -> INTERACT
#3: PROBLEM SOLVE
#4: "interaction function"
#5: PROBLEM: element relation and interaction function
#6: make new sense functions

>>> FINISH MIRA
                 plan:
                >check if we know the answer already (whether with compose or composeMETA)
                >else check with sense and CONFIRM or DENY expectations
                >confirm, skip
                >deny -> MEMORIZE AND ADD TO MEMORY
                DONE
		^^^^ where senses come into play

use delta2 between guesses and delta1's + USE FIXED POINT PROPERTY
then write or skip
=> sleeping
sort out memory (delete duplicates) + lexicosort

>>>problem solving
-> ASK QUESTIONS

#INIT OTHER CLONE AS IM MAKING A LOT OF CHANGES
Cloneinit()
multiple analysis ideas
>eval the return
interaction
>delta( input COMPOSEMETA mira, eval(input) )
==
eval
construct diff on graphs for SI
:> missing edges -> needs this to work
:>extra edges -> WTF???
HINT: FINDING THE MISSING LINK FOR STUFF
aka "if I had this I could do that and finish the problem" -> related to problem solving


PROBLEMS:
WHAT IS THE MINIMAL WTF
WHAT IS THE SPICE/THAT MAKES THIS BETTER INTRINSICALLY THAN OTHERS
eval
recursion
responsive
problem solving
audio/visual

HINT:
interact (just want to be right/ check out 'quick dieas'/ this needs clone to work already) -> write down -> evaling/analysis -> eval analysis ON clone -> check if clone works -> ????'problem solving' -> audiovisual


FAR
-> TALK/INTERACT WITH THE WORLD
ideally I should teach mira now (hint: use actual school curriculums)
teaching
==


KNOW:function(s) that we see
WANT: given arbitrary input AND input matches abstraction for function(s) input, HOW CAN I GUESS AN OUTPUT?
hint: WE CANNOT:
if
-> haven't seen it before
-> haven't seen the abstraction for it before
-> all you can do is learn/memorize it
IDEA:
SI ON PARTS (totalSI) => FORCE ABSTRACTION FUNCTIONFOR FINITE FUNCTIONS
^ this needs basis to have the right parts AND for formatting to "be ok"

==
what do we have?
python evaluation to tell yes/no
abstractions through delta2
composemeta evaluation through delta3 <- delta2

hint: WE NEED MORE RESTRICTIONS OTHERWISE AT THIS POINT IT IS JUST EXPERIENCE AS I SAID EARLIER
==
problem:
preventing duplicate writing to unordered is fucking irrelevant because I search in ordered memory
so during 'sleep' I should just clear out duplicates

hint:
alphabet theorem and shortening basis if possible
alphabet theorem and morpheme picking
==
arbtrary timestream analysis is bad
instead look at the audio/visual codecs or whatever for python and figure out how I can win from them

character based analysis
PICKING THE RIGHT MORPHEMES

NEXT STEP: 
ANALYSIS OF ARBITRARY TIMESTREAM
WHEN/WHAT TO RESPOND
ANALYSIS IS KEY WORD




cloning is expensive, when do I clone?
when I clone I have to make sure to update MIRA_B

#in sleep mode, organize memory
hint: the current directory should be the safe copy and the 'other' copy is the working copy
hint: need to call the clone to ''take over''



STRAT:
HOW TO PROBLEM SOLVE:
IMAGE:
[print("x"),x]
[print("y"), ???]

HOW TO GUESS ???
data -> apply deltas properly -> make morphemes using deltas -> recognize morphemes instead




==
problem:
statement+ replacement on arbitrary timestream
>>code
>>visual [resource intensive]
>>audio [resource intensive]
recognize  special characters in deltav2

END THIS PROGRAM AND RESTART MIRA WITH NEW INPUTS/NEW VERSION


=====PUSHED WAY BACK===========================================================================
another SI problem:
'SI as much as you can'
SI(A,B)
but then we figure out h subset A is SI to j subset B
(hint: need some kind of size restriction else it will take too long | 7 factorial is 5040)
so then other parts need to be figured out somehow
-> why I pushed this back
this is easy to do, just do n choose and then feed that into mira
ALSO if you have a good delta you don't need this function technically


#delete UNORDERED file so that you don't duplicate stuff (this is in lexicosort)
-> GIVE WARNING IF FILE EXISTS ALREADY


>make debug print function (and make it so I can debug specific functions)
#ACTUALLY HARDER THAN IT LOOKS DUE TO HOW TO FEED INTO PRINT FUNCTION (hint: fucking hard or I don't have enough XP)

GOAL: MAKE MY OWN TAIL FUNCTION
TOOLS: 
can read forward
I know maxlines
HINT: read forward X amount of lines at a time?
>if we know max amount of lines we can just skip up to that line?

AUTOVISION is outdated with Lval

>have to log changes using github?
